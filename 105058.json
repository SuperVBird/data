From football to film to philanthropy, people are using Twitter to discover what’s new about what they find interesting.</div>\n<p>Twitter has always been about getting a lot in a little. The constraint of 140 characters drives conciseness and lets you quickly discover and share what&#8217;s happening. Yet, we&#8217;ve learned something since starting Twitter—life doesn&#8217;t always fit into 140 characters or less.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re introducing a new, re-engineered Twitter.com that provides an easier, faster, and richer experience.</p>\n<p>On the site, you’ll see the familiar timeline, yet underneath each Tweet is a handful of information, deeper context and even embedded media. Simply click on an individual Tweet and a details pane slides out on the right and reveals this content.</p>\n<p>You can find out more about the enhancements <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/newtwitter\">on this information page</a>. Here are some highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>New design.</b> The site has a cleaner timeline and a rich details pane that instantly adds more impact to individual Tweets while still maintaining the simplicity of the timeline. And, experience infinite scroll &#8212; you no longer have to click “more” to view additional Tweets.</li>\n<li><b>Media.</b> Now, it’s easy to see embedded photos and videos directly on Twitter, thanks to partnerships with DailyBooth, deviantART, Etsy, Flickr, Justin.TV, Kickstarter, Kiva, Photozou, Plixi, Twitgoo, TwitPic, TwitVid, USTREAM, Vimeo, yfrog, and YouTube. </li>\n<li><b>Related content.</b> When you click a Tweet, the details pane shows additional information related to the author or subject. Depending on the Tweet’s content, you may see: replies, other Tweets by that user, a map of where a geotagged Tweet was sent from, and more.</li>\n<li><b>Mini profiles.</b> Click a username to see a mini profile without navigating from the page, which provides quick access to account information, including bio and recent Tweets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> These changes will roll out as a preview over the next several weeks starting with a very small percentage of registered accounts tonight. During the preview, you&#8217;ll be able to switch back and forth so you have time to grow accustomed to the way things work. Eventually, everyone will have the updated version of Twitter.com. We are incredibly proud of the work the Twitter web team has accomplished. We hope you are too!</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23958943-2404198375630040688?l=blog.twitter.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"http://img.tongji.linezing.com/1017243/tongji.gif\" /><img src=\"http://img.tongji.linezing.com/997968/tongji.gif\" /></p>\n","author":176,"categories":[1],"tags":[3764]}
