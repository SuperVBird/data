And in PRC the evidence disclosed by the litigants<br />\nwill be verified in three aspects, i.e. authenti</span>city,<br />\nrelevance and validity. It is worthwhile to note they have<br />\nreference to each other.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Sometimes, when you argue the<br />\nirrelevance or invalidity of a written evidence, the judge may ask<br />\nwhether or not you admit the authenticity of it, and the question<br />\nmay get you in trap when you do not challenge the truth of it only<br />\nbecause you could not prove it bearing a forged stamp or<br />\nsignature,etc.. The court’s fact-finding is likely based on this<br />\ncontroversial evidence when the court consider it to be relevant<br />\nand valid.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Hence, as far as an irrelevant and/or<br />\ninvalid evidence is concernced, its truth should be denied or<br />\nchallenged without any doubt because the truth involves the facts<br />\nto be proved except the evidence itself.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In some countries with Christianity<br />\ntradition, witnesses have to swear on the bible before making a<br />\ntestimony in the court. God as the holy agency insure to some<br />\nextent the truth of affidavit.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In PRC, we have no such a holy<br />\nagency, not only the witnesses concerned with one litigant but also<br />\nthe expert or proffessional witnesses appointed by one litigant are<br />\nhard to be trusted sometimes.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Everything has an exception. Some guy<br />\nwho used to be my colleague and speaks fluent English, had acted as<br />\na temprory intepretor of opponent’s witness who did not know<br />\nEnglish in a foreign court. Even the the opponent party appreciated<br />\nthe objective and accuracy of his translation. He was often<br />\ncontemptuous of lack of sophistication, which to some<br />\nextent make him to be very honest. <span> </span><span> </span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n</p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"450\" height=\"309\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=2ea93c5b7b\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/msuvD\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[9400]}
