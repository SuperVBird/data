Last year <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/went-walkabout-brought-back-google-wave.html\">at Google I/O</a>, when we launched our developer preview of Google Wave, a web app for real time communication and collaboration, it set a high bar for what was possible in a web browser. We showed character-by-character live typing, and the ability to drag-and-drop files from the desktop, even “playback” the history of changes—all within a browser. Developers in the audience stood and cheered. Some even <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/quaelin/3574598412/\">waved their laptops</a>.</p>\n<p>We were equally jazzed about Google Wave internally, even though we weren’t quite sure how users would respond to this radically different kind of communication. The use cases we’ve seen show the power of this technology: sharing images and other media in real time; improving spell-checking by understanding not just an individual word, but also the context of each word; and enabling third-party developers to build new tools like consumer gadgets for travel, or robots to check code. </p>\n<p>But despite these wins, and numerous loyal fans, Wave has not seen the user adoption we would have liked. We don’t plan to continue developing Wave as a standalone product, but we will maintain the site at least through the end of the year and extend the technology for use in other Google projects. The central parts of the code, as well as the protocols that have driven many of Wave’s innovations, like drag-and-drop and character-by-character live typing, are already available as open source, so customers and partners can continue the innovation we began. In addition, we will work on tools so that users can easily “liberate” their content from Wave.</p>\n<p>Wave has taught us a lot, and we are proud of the team for the ways in which they have pushed the boundaries of computer science. We are excited about what they will develop next as we continue to create innovations with the potential to advance technology and the wider web.</p>\n<p><span>Posted by Urs Hölzle, Senior Vice President, Operations &#038; Google Fellow</span></p>\n<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10861780-4402136060711903179?l=googleblog.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/MKuf?a=aSZyyQIeeWY:P_BsHl-GeZA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/MKuf?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/MKuf?a=aSZyyQIeeWY:P_BsHl-GeZA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/MKuf?i=aSZyyQIeeWY:P_BsHl-GeZA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/MKuf?a=aSZyyQIeeWY:P_BsHl-GeZA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/MKuf?i=aSZyyQIeeWY:P_BsHl-GeZA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/aSZyyQIeeWY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></div>\n<p><img src=\"http://img.tongji.linezing.com/1017243/tongji.gif\" /><img src=\"http://img.tongji.linezing.com/997968/tongji.gif\" /></p>\n<p>请看原文：<br />\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/mkuf/~3/aszyyqieewy/update-on-google-wave.html\" title=\"Update on Google Wave\">Update on Google Wave</a></p>\n","author":176,"categories":[1],"tags":[]}
