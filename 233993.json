Dr. Lobsang Sangay&#8217;s &#8216;Democracy in Exile: The Case for Tibet&#8217; will be presented in English.<br />Politics in China has been particularly eventful during the first half of 2012, with people around the world shocked by a series of events in quick succession: more than 30 Tibetan self-immolations in the Tibetan Plateau; the downfall of political star Bo Xilai, a powerful member of the Politburo; the escape of blind legal advocate Chen Guangcheng from his heavily guarded home in Shandong to the US Embassy in Beijing, and  the subsequent negotiations for him to study law in New York. These surprising episodes are accompanied by renewed calls for genuine political reform. </p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, the upcoming 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party offers a stimulus for the political imagination. What has happened to Chinese communist rule and Chinese society? How are political and social developments in China related to international communities? Is there an opportunity for transforming political change toward democracy? This roundtable will provide a stimulating platform for informed discussions and meaningful debates.</p>\n<p>Speakers include leading academics in the field, Prof. Yeau-Tarn Lee of National Chengchi University, Dr. Chien-Yuan Tseng of Chung Hua University, and Dr. Feng Chongyi of the UTS China Research Centre. They will be joined by leading Chinese democracy activists such as Dr. Wang Juntao of the China Democracy Party and Dr. Yang Jianli of Initiatives for China.</p>\n<p>Dr. Lobsang Sangay will join the roundtable from 1pm-2pm to present ‘Democracy in Exile: The Case for Tibet’, which explores complicated issues of Tibetan Democracy and provides an update of political development in the Tibetan community in exile and in Tibet since the Dalai Lama handed over his political authority to an elected leader and democratic institutions in August 2011.</p>\n<p>Dr Lobsang Sangay was born in a Tibetan refugee settlement in northern India. As a Fulbright scholar, he was the first Tibetan to receive a doctorate from the Harvard Law School in 2004. In 2007, he was selected as the one of the 24 Young Leaders of Asia by the Asia Society. He worked as a senior fellow at Harvard University for a number of years during which he organised landmark conferences between the Dalai Lama and Chinese scholars. An expert on Tibet, international human rights law, democratic constitutionalism and conflict resolution, Dr Sangay has lectured at various universities and think-tanks throughout Europe, Asia and North America. Since taking office as Kalon Tripa (Prime Minister) of the Central Tibetan Administration in Dharamsala, India, in 2011, Dr Sangay has met with political leaders of various countries including the US, the UK, Japan and the EU. Dr Sangay calls for a peaceful resolution of the Tibet issue and supports the Dalai Lama’s Middle Way Policy, seeking genuine autonomy for Tibet under the constitution of China.</p>\n<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4214948278400391962-1368979986731520959?l=loveaiww.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n</p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=b4fd4ae247\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/mstlf\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18269,20534],"tags":[16910,19197,8584,9625]}
