In the mid-1980s, when Liu Xiaobo rose to prominence within<br />\nthe literary world, I was a visiting research fellow at Oxford, and<br />\nbecame familiar with his ideas through Chinese periodicals<br />\npublished overseas. Contrary to the view held by many, what brought<br />\nLiu such attention at the time wasn’t merely the sharpness of his<br />\nwriting or his pointed critiques, but also how thorough he was in<br />\nhis thinking and how much more influential his criticisms were of<br />\nmainstream ideology and dogma in China than those of other<br />\nintellectuals. </p>\n<p>\nThroughout the student-led democracy movement of 1989, I had the<br />\nopportunity to observe Liu Xiaobo. He had been lecturing abroad for<br />\nquite some time, but when signs of suppression began to appear and<br />\nothers began making arrangements to flee overseas, Liu Xiaobo<br />\ninstead chose to discontinue his academic pursuits and return to<br />\nBeijing to immerse himself in the struggle for democracy. On the<br />\nnights of June 3rd and 4th, I was in Tiananmen Square, not far from<br />\nthe Monument to the People’s Heroes. Liu Xiaobo, along with three<br />\nother intellectuals, was taking part in the student hunger strike;<br />\nit was they, who, on the early morning of the 4th, convinced the<br />\nstudents to peacefully evacuate the Square and begin discussion<br />\nwith the soldiers suppressing them, negotiating a smooth<br />\nwithdrawal. I remember clearly the difficulty and pain Liu Xiaobo<br />\nand his comrades-in-arms— raised as they had been with the most<br />\nradical type of an education — experienced in reaching this<br />\ndecision, one which only later was understood to have saved the<br />\nlives of several hundred students. </p>\n<p>\nLiu Xiaobo’s involvement in the 1989 democracy movement illustrates<br />\nhis transformation from an eminent cultural critic to public<br />\nintellectual concerned with social and political problems and human<br />\nrights activist. His activities in 1989 can be seen as formative in<br />\nthe entirety of his following writings and other works,<br />\ncharacterized by an unwavering bravery and refusal to back down in<br />\nthe face of danger and suppression, by the pursuit and defense of<br />\nhuman rights, humanism, peace and other universal values and,<br />\nfinally, adherence to the practice of rational dialogue, compromise<br />\nand non-violence. </p>\n<p>\nFor many years, Liu Xiaobo has been the most representative figure<br />\nand foremost organizer in mainland China’s struggle for human<br />\nrights and democracy. He has been at the forefront of protests made<br />\nin support of writers and intellectuals imprisoned for their work,<br />\nin appeals made for farmers and urban residents deprived of land<br />\nand home, in advocating for protection of the religious and<br />\ncultural rights of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, and in<br />\nfostering constructive dialogue toward seeing peaceful coexistence<br />\nbetween Han and all ethnic minorities. In a series of protests<br />\naimed at upholding the fundamental rights of all Chinese citizens,<br />\nLiu Xiaobo placed consistent emphasis on the fact that the rights<br />\nand freedoms of all Chinese citizens are protected both by the<br />\nChinese constitution and in law, as well as a series of United<br />\nNations and international declarations and covenants signed by the<br />\nChinese government which safeguard human and civil rights. Liu<br />\nplaced particular emphasis on seeing the Chinese government’s<br />\nobligation and responsibility to abide by its own constitution and<br />\nlaws as well as international covenants as commitments to both the<br />\nChinese people and the international<br />\ncommunity. </p>\n<p>\nIn launching and signing Charter 08 in 2008, Liu Xiaobo’s intent<br />\nwas to reaffirm, with the Chinese government already recognizing<br />\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and having signed the<br />\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, that these<br />\nare the norms with regard to interaction between the Chinese people<br />\nand the Chinese government: to be a qualified and responsible<br />\nmember of the international community would require China to adopt<br />\nthe universal values embodied within these two documents. For this,<br />\nLiu Xiaobo was imprisoned, his third arrest as a result of striving<br />\nfor freedom and democracy in China. On Christmas Day, 2009, Liu<br />\nXiaobo was sentenced to 11 years in prison. In his final statement<br />\nto the court, Liu Xiaobo said that he had neither enemies nor hate;<br />\nto those who kept him under surveillance and arrested him, to the<br />\npolice who interrogated him and to the public attorneys who<br />\nprosecuted and judge who sentenced him, the message Liu Xiaobo felt<br />\nit most important to convey was that despite their various roles<br />\nleading to his imprisonment, he considered none of them his<br />\nenemy. </p>\n<p>\nAs a political theorist and public intellectual also concerned with<br />\nsocial and political problems and the defense of human rights, as<br />\nwell as a signatory to Charter 08, I strongly feel the need to<br />\npoint out that in the judgment read by the court which sentenced<br />\nLiu Xiaobo, evidence cited to prove Liu’s guilt included his<br />\nparticipation in Charter 08, that he collected signatures for it,<br />\nand even the content of the Charter itself—naked provocation of the<br />\nuniversal values held by humankind, common norms held by the<br />\ninternational community, and especially of the Chinese people<br />\nthemselves. </p>\n<p>\nAs I see it, the Nobel Peace Prize both embodies and represents the<br />\ncore values of civilized society: respect for life and faith, the<br />\nsanctity of the individual and the right to express one’s self.<br />\nGiven that Liu Xiaobo and many others signatories of Charter 08<br />\nhave faced persecution and oppression merely for reaffirming these<br />\nvalues, the blatant challenge they face behooves a response from<br />\nthe civilized world; to bestow the Nobel Peace Prize upon Liu<br />\nXiaobo is one of the strongest responses which could be sent. This<br />\nwould, clearly and unambiguously, reaffirm the values held most<br />\ndearly by humankind, serve as monumental support for the struggle<br />\nfor the freedom and democracy which China’s 1.3 billion people<br />\nlack, and would mark a major step in defense of world peace.<br />\nChinese authorities are able to destroy this country’s constitution<br />\nand trample upon its laws wantonly, which is why external voices,<br />\nvoices from the international community, are needed to make Chinese<br />\nauthorities pay heed. Bestowing the Nobel Peace Prize upon Liu<br />\nXiaobo would serve as indirect opposition to the current state of<br />\naffairs, as well as a both authoritative and effective<br />\nsignal. </p>\n<p>\nLiu Xiaobo’s ideas and actions, in my view, are entirely congruous<br />\nto the actions and ideas held by His Holiness the Dalai Lama,<br />\nArchbishop emeritus Desmond Tutu and Aung San Suu Kyi; all have<br />\nendeavored to use tactics of non-violence in effecting gradual<br />\nchange, of persuasion and compromise in upholding human rights and<br />\nin making the transition toward a peaceful society. With protest<br />\nmovements now taking place all across China within every community<br />\nand at every level, it is imperative we remain vigilant in<br />\npreventing violent trends from taking hold. Awarding Liu Xiaobo the<br />\nNobel Peace Prize would have just such an effect: people struggling<br />\nfor human rights in China and around the world would find hope and<br />\nstrength in rational, non-violent resistance, and see anew the<br />\npossibility of putting violence and authoritarian rule where they<br />\nboth belong—in the past and behind us all. </p>\n<p>\nCordially Yours,</p>\n<p>\n Xu Youyu </p>\n<p>\nPhilosopher and professor with the Chinese Academy of Social<br />\nSciences</p>\n<p>\nHolder of the Olof Palme Chair, Sweden, 2001-2002</p>\n<p>\n（本文中文译本链接<a href=\"http://shifeike.blog125.fc2blog.net/blog-entry-118.html\">http://shifeike.blog125.fc2blog.net/blog-entry-118.html</a>，中英文版权均属徐友渔先生）</p>\n</div>\n","author":176,"categories":[9203],"tags":[9410]}
