No sir, in fact, it seems that the number of Chinese<br />\ncitizens who are able to access the Internet has already surpassed the half<br />\nbillion mark, which is more than one third of China’s total population. This<br />\nstatistic is furnished by the China Internet Network Information Center, a<br />\nstate-run organization, so it is as close as it can get to the actual figure.</span></p>\n<p><span>It would be<br />\ninteresting to see how the Internet generation in China will help shape and<br />\ngrow the country, which might eventually become the world’s largest economy as<br />\nit steps on the accelerator to overtake the US after they sped past Japan last<br />\nyear. According to a translated quotation from the China Media Project in Hong<br />\nKong, journalist Hu Yong mentioned the importance of the explosion of Internet<br />\nuse in China by summing it up, “The Internet cannot usher in dramatic change to<br />\npolitical life in China, but it can promote the creation of social capital on<br />\nthe basis of citizen rights and duties, giving rise to and strengthening social<br />\nforces independent of the Chinese state.”</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=738338\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"738338\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1000,"categories":[9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
