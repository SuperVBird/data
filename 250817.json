The protest will begin at London time 2pm, outside of Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office. Around 100 people including students, professionals, as well as others who took their children along joined the protest.</p>\n<p>Protesters brought roses to the site – Red roses are dedicated to the good spirits of teachers and parents, with white roses brought to be spray painted with red, with red spray paint to symbolize communism ideologies in dedication to the students. Campaigners are demanding for the Hong Kong government to retrieve National Education, and allow the students to learn to think independently. They are also asked to bring their own slogan banners and will hand over a petition, requesting the office to relay the message to Chief Executive Leung Chun Ying.</p>\n<p>One of the campaign founders – Kenneth Wong, has stated that through organizing the peaceful demonstration that it will support and continue the movement: “Hong Kong is an international city; I hope that the activities will bring awareness of its issues to places around the world, with education as the most important factor.”</p>\n<p>Another campaign founder – Kelly Chung, is a student currently studying in the United Kingdom. She expressed that she was moved by the actions of Hong Kong students and parents, and believes that Hong Kong people should unite to protect for the next generation regardless of where they are in the world. “National Education cannot be ignored. The module that is being introduced will very much distort the students’ perspectives and values of the world, therefore facilitating children to think independently is the most important aspect.”</p>\n<p>The supporters may be in the United Kingdom, but their heart is still bonded to Hong Kong. All protestors will be designing their own various signposts and banners, with others to distribute booklets that will explain the module. The movement is extending to various locations around the globe, and many other overseas Hong Kong people are initiating campaigns in support of Hong Kong students to oppose National Education.</p>\n</p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=2ea93c5b7b\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/msuvD\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18269,20534],"tags":[20406,19197]}
