The first<br />\ntrend was a general shift from emotionally-driven nationalist chatter as the<br />\ndefining tone of China’s internet toward a more basic attention to issues of<br />\npublic welfare. The second was the rise of what we can call the “social power<br />\nof the internet” (</span><span>网络社会力</span><span>).<br />\nAnd the third trend was a more pronounced deficit in understanding on the<br />\ngovernment’s part about the role it should play in a networked society. While<br />\nit became readily apparent, that is, that we now have a networked civil society<br />\nin China, it became clearer at the same time that we lack government<br />\nadministrators who are internet literate (</span><span>网络化的治理者</span><span>).</span><span></span></p>\n<p><b><span>The Turn from Online<br />\nNationalism</span></b><span></span></p>\n<p><span>Nationalism has been a defining issue<br />\non China’s internet since the very beginning. For example, People’s University<br />\nof China professor Peng Lan (</span><span>彭兰</span><span>)<br />\nhas argued that one landmark event in the emergence of online public opinion in<br />\nChina [as a social force] was internet-based opposition by the international<br />\nChinese community (including mainland Chinese) against <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia\"><b><span>attacks on<br />\nethnic Chinese during the Indonesian riots in May 1998</span></b></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>In “The Glory and Promise of Online<br />\nPublic Opinion” (</span><span>网上舆论的光荣与梦想</span><span>),<br />\nwritten by Lin Chufang (</span><span>林楚方</span><span>)<br />\nand Zhao Ling (</span><span>赵凌</span><span>) and published in Southern<br />\nWeekly on June 5, 2003, the authors argued that, “The turning-point<br />\ndate when domestic [Chinese] web platforms were used to voice public opinion<br />\nwas May 9, 1999, when People’s Daily Online opened up a forum to rally<br />\nopposition to the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade by NATO forces.<br />\nThis was the first current affairs news-related forum to be opened up by the<br />\nwebsite of a traditional media outlet.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Nationalist sentiment has long<br />\npersisted as a perennial hot topic on China’s internet. Issues like<br />\nSino-American relations, Sino-Japanese relations and the question of Taiwan<br />\nhave always invited fierce activity on the internet in China, even sometimes<br />\nsetting off mass rallies offline. This trend has been noted frequently by<br />\nobservers outside China. The Economist magazine even at one<br />\ntime devoted a sub-headed section to China’s “online nationalism” in a report<br />\non the digital era nationalism called “<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/11792535\">Cyber-nationalism: The Brave New World<br />\nof E-Hatred</a>”.</span></p>\n<p><span>The nationalist trend online peaked<br />\nin 2008 following March riots in Tibet that year, and in the midst of the<br />\ninternational torch relay for the Beijing Olympics. That time marked an<br />\nunfortunate setback in the relations of China and the West, ushering in a<br />\ndeeper sense of isolation in China that threatened to push China into a more<br />\nprotective and less open posture. This is an ongoing issue, and if the West<br />\ncontinues to take an antagonistic attitude toward China’s rise, it is conceivable<br />\nthat China could be pushed back further, even onto its old path of isolation<br />\nand decline.</span></p>\n<p><span>The successful hosting of the Beijing<br />\nOlympics in 2008 was a symbolic moment for China’s rise, and a moment of deep<br />\npride for Chinese. But just as the curtain closed on the Olympics, the<br />\nrevelation of widespread melamine contamination throughout China’s dairy<br />\nindustry, a scandal directly impacting millions of Chinese families, came a<br />\njarring reminder that external glory cannot disguise internal decay. The impact<br />\non Chinese society and on the country’s manufacturing sector was profound. The<br />\nwidespread sense of debilitating setback was conveyed by Chinese internet users<br />\nin a vivid couplet:</span></p>\n<p><span>We labor half a year to<br />\nturn a new page,</span><span> </span><span>辛辛苦苦大半年，</span><span><br />\nAnd in a single night are returned to the pre-Olympic age. </span><span>一夜回到奥运前</span><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Ever since that time, the confident<br />\ntone of a China rising has flattened into notes of sorrow among Chinese.<br />\nShanghai successfully hosted the World Expo in 2010, but quite quickly came<br />\nnews of a disastrous fire in Shanghai that claimed 58 lives and injured scores<br />\nof others. Just as in the eyes of some the so-called China Model was in its<br />\nflushest moment of success, even meriting emulation by other countries, the<br />\nhigh-speed rail collision last summer completely annihilated this fantasy.</span></p>\n<p><span>People started questioning whether<br />\nthis was really a model at all. Online public opinion grew<br />\nturbulent, and one user famously wrote: “China, please slow your soaring steps,<br />\nwait for your people, wait for your soul, wait for your morals, wait for your<br />\nconscience! We don’t want train collisions or bridge collapses. We don’t want<br />\nour roads becoming pitfalls, or our homes becoming deathtraps. Move more<br />\nslowly. Let all lives enjoy freedom and dignity, so that no one is cast aside<br />\nby the times, so that every person can reach our destination smoothly and in<br />\npeace.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Many people still sympathetically<br />\npush for greater Chinese nationalism, calling for a stronger China. But ever<br />\nsince 2008 the trend has been for nationalistic agendas to take a back seat to<br />\nagendas relating to the welfare of the people. As social tensions in China have<br />\ngrown more serious, Chinese have devoted more attention to social development<br />\nissues that are more concretely relevant to their lives. As the anniversary of<br />\nJapan’s invasion of China approached in 2010, the mood at Sina Weibo, one of<br />\nChina’s top social media platforms, was extremely tense — the fear being that<br />\nChinese might try to organize anti-Japanese rallies, drawing the ire of the authorities<br />\nto the Sina Weibo platform itself, which at the time was merely a “beta<br />\nversion” and could be shuttered at a moment’s notice.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the end, “September 18″, this date<br />\nthat had erstwhile been so sensitive, never became a major topic of discussion<br />\non Sina Weibo in 2010. Instead, the hottest discussion centered on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yihuang_self-immolation_incident\"><b><span>the Yihuang<br />\nself-immolation case in southern China’s Jiangxi province</span></b></a>, a<br />\ncase exposing the evils of forced property demolition in China and lack of<br />\nrights protection.</span></p>\n<p><span>Clearly, the winds are changing. When<br />\nyou cannot find safe milk for your child to drink, when their school buses are<br />\nhazardous, when you worry that you might be exposed to dangerous recycled<br />\ncooking oils if you go out to a local restaurant, when the city where you live<br />\nis choked with pollution and you have no idea what the actual PM2.5 measures<br />\nfor the most dangerous air particles are, the question that possesses you above<br />\nall else is what direction Chinese society is heading. You care more about how<br />\nthe people of China can enjoy lives of peace and prosperity, and less about the<br />\nmurderous logic of the Boxer Rebellion. [NOTE: Hu is suggesting here that<br />\ntrends of extreme nationalism in China are marked with the same sort of<br />\nanti-foreign violence seen during the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion\"><b><span>Boxer Rebellion</span></b></a>.]</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><b><span>Online Social Power<br />\nEmerges</span></b><span></span></p>\n<p><span>The second trend in 2011 was the<br />\ngrowing maturing of what we can call “online social power” (</span><span>网络社会力</span><span>). Since the 1970s, researchers in China have talked about the need to<br />\nencourage the development of non-governmental organizations, to move away from<br />\nurban communities based on the old work unit system and to carry out other<br />\nsocial reforms in order to find new points of development. Today we can say<br />\nwithout hesitation that an independent and richly participatory civil society<br />\nis emerging on China’s internet. The internet in China today has quite a<br />\ndifferent political function from what we see in countries with relatively full<br />\npolitical freedoms. The internet cannot usher in dramatic change to political<br />\nlife in China, but it can promote the creation of social capital on the basis<br />\nof citizen rights and duties, giving rise to and strengthening social forces<br />\nindependent of the Chinese state.</span></p>\n<p><span>China is entering an era of “rights.”<br />\nFarmers, workers and an newly-emerging middle class are all fighting for their<br />\ncivil rights. Since the 1990s, along with a number of “important turns and<br />\nother reversals” (Sun Liping’s phrase), there has been a clear expansion of<br />\nsocial conflict and opposition in China, both in terms of frequency and scale.<br />\nResearchers have observed that perhaps one of the most apparent new<br />\ncharacteristics of this [social unrest] is the use of sophisticated electronic<br />\ntechnologies, which enable protesters to connect more readily and make it<br />\npossible also to communicate with media and supporters in the international<br />\ncommunity.</span></p>\n<p><span>Thanks to technology, new social<br />\nrelationships and bonds are forming in China, and new forms of mutual interest<br />\ntaking shape. As a direct result, the mobilization capacity (</span><span>动员能力</span><span>) for related social movements has increased. The recent Wukan incident in<br />\nGuangdong is a prime example of this trend.</span></p>\n<p><span>The efforts by Chinese to fight for<br />\ntheir civil rights are of course tied up with efforts to fight for their right<br />\nto information. In the broadest sense, the right to information means the<br />\nfreedom to converse, connect, gather and coordinate without fear. These rights<br />\nare the same rights guaranteed through the human rights documents of the United<br />\nNations and the constitutions of various countries, all of which collectively<br />\naffirm the right of citizens to access and share information. For<br />\nexample, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/\"><b><span>Article 19 of<br />\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights</span></b></a> affirms that:<br />\n“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right<br />\nincludes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and<br />\nimpart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”</span></p>\n<p><span>In terms of basic rights on the<br />\ninternet, an international consensus has already emerged, including a firm<br />\ncommitment to freedom of access and the freedom to share information (</span><span>发布自由</span><span>). Internet rights, therefore, already exist as a matter of convention<br />\nwithin the [international] political context, where many people argue that the<br />\nsame standards of freedom and human rights that operate offline apply to the<br />\nonline environment as well.</span></p>\n<p><b><span>Lacking a Networked<br />\nMindset in Governance</span></b><span></span></p>\n<p><span>This brings the third trend that has<br />\nbecome clearer in China’s online public opinion environment. This is that while<br />\nwe already have a networked civil society in China, we continue to lack a<br />\nnetworked leadership — which is to say a government that understands and<br />\naccommodates the internet on its own terms.</span></p>\n<p><span>The internet naturally generates<br />\nknowledge and value from the end user and not from centralized gatekeepers —<br />\nand the right to connectivity, use and dissemination are to a great degree<br />\nbuilt into the fabric of the internet. For this reason, the building of<br />\ninternet governance policies should proceed along the same lines, raising<br />\ncompetition, encouraging innovation, permitting free expression, raising<br />\ncredibility, all with minimal government interference.</span></p>\n<p><span>Unfortunately, internet governance in<br />\nChina at present goes entirely against these principles. If China’s internet is<br />\nto continue to develop, internet users and the government will have to work<br />\ntogether toward mutual interests, jointly formulating principles [for internet<br />\nuse and development].</span></p>\n<p><span>For the government’s part, it must be<br />\nclear that web users are not only to be monitored but also to be served — that<br />\nin fact the principal attitude must be one of service. A totalistic approach<br />\n[to internet governance] by the government will only engender an internet mob (</span><span>暴民型网民</span><span>), while service-oriented [internet governance] will foster a population<br />\nof responsible internet users. For the government’s part, building a networked<br />\nsociety requires first and foremost a change of attitude in governance, a<br />\ntransition from totalistic governance (</span><span>全能政府</span><span>) to service-oriented governance (</span><span>服务型政府</span><span>).</span></p>\n<p><span>In such a government approach,<br />\ninternet-related problems should be solved in a “web<br />\nuser–market–society–government” sequence. Issues, that is, that web users can<br />\nsolve themselves should be solved by web users; issues web users cannot solve<br />\non their own that can be solved by the market should be solved by the market;<br />\nissues that the market cannot resolve and that can be resolved by society<br />\nshould be resolved by society; for issues that cannot be resolved by society,<br />\nthe government should step up to offer services and guidance.</span></p>\n<p><span>A service-oriented government does<br />\nnot mean entirely eliminating controls, only that controls are implemented for<br />\nthe sake of service, not for the sake of controls themselves. Such controls<br />\nwould be restricted the law, with a fixed scope and procedures and a clear<br />\nsystem of responsibility.</span></p>\n<p><span>When people are denied the<br />\nopportunity to participate in the formulation of rules, these rules lose<br />\nacceptance and credibility, and stability is difficult to achieve. This<br />\nprincipal is as true online as offline.</span></p>\n<p><span>It is impossible for the government<br />\nto serve as the only source of public administration (</span><span>公共治理者</span><span>) in an atmosphere as complex and diverse as China’s today. The government<br />\nwill have to coordinate with non-governmental organizations, social groups and<br />\nthe public to better manage public affairs. And in the same way, an approach to<br />\ninternet governance based on serving the interests of web users would<br />\nnecessitate a fundamental change in the government’s role.</span></p>\n<p><span>Drawing hundreds of millions of<br />\nChinese web users into the process of internet governance requires, first of<br />\nall, respect for the basic rights of Chinese internet users. The benefits for<br />\nChina in such a shift would be substantial. Chinese internet users today are<br />\nnot unlike Chinese farmers thirty years ago, or township and village<br />\nenterprises twenty years ago, capable of unleashing immense [productive] forces<br />\noutside the state system (</span><span>非体制的力量</span><span>).</span></p>\n<p><i><span>This commentary was<br />\ntranslated and edited from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://view.news.qq.com/a/20120113/000037.htm\"><b><span>a piece originally appearing<br />\nin China Newsweekly magazine on January 13</span></b></a>.</span></i><span></span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"450\" height=\"309\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1000,"categories":[9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
