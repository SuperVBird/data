One of my Chinese reader left a angry  comment because he/she thought my English is poor. Yes, my English is  poor, and the word poor can not describe my English level. He/she said  it is bullshit, and I think bullshit is more precise.</p>\n<p>But so what? I love my bullshit English way. For years, I use my  bullshit English talk with American, write E-mail to my domain hosts.  All my grammatical errors didn’t bother them, they knew what I tried to  express exactly. But to my fellow countryman, my grammatical errors can  always make them rush into the red rag. Why?</p>\n<p>4 years ago, my friend Michael Anti, a former journalist, was trying  to write some articles in his blog, for God sake, in ENGLISH! Most of  comments were trying to teach him what is the correct/proper English  written by Chinese. Guess what? Anti gave up English writing, and  replace his English blog with a Spanish version! We do have many kind  English teachers in China.</p>\n<p>It is not a joke. Many Chinese graduates can not even say whole  English sentence, but they are all the English grammar masters with kind  of sexy dumb style. If you ask them: How are you? There will be cause  the most famous answer: Fine, Thanks, and you? But if you change a  little bit, like: What’s up, dude? Here comes the sexy dumb style&#8212;this  grammar guru will look up blankly and slowly, and answer you with  charming hesitation: C…ceiling?</p>\n<p>From then on, the guru will change into a one-word-one-timed  creature. And the guru’s brain is boiling, because the brain is trying  to search every grammar book in memory to find the right answer which  fits “What’s up”. If you want to see how the brains dripping out of a  human being’s nose next time, live, just try Aloha.</p>\n<p>Gurus are really proud of their grammar. Because they’ve spend more  than 16 years on it. Good grammar means high score. High score means  personal success. And how dare I to insult the base of their success?  Those shrill comments are my karma.</p>\n<p>But I don’t think the English world is that intolerant. Even “long  time no see” can be a idiom, and English dictionary seems is all O.K.  about it. When all the Chinese grammar masters were pulling each  other’hair to debate how to translate Guanxi into English properly, the  American editors just put this word in Newspaper. They didn’t waste a  minute to discuss if Guanxi is countable nouns or not. This is English,  it just absorbs anything new, anything interesting, anything valuable.  Because language is a kind of tool, not a course. As a tool language can  help people to express themselves. Even broken English can express  something meaningful to enrich English world. On the other hand, the  thought of writing a perfect article without any grammatical error is  killing the article itself.</p>\n<p>Yes, my article is full of grammatical errors. Yes, you can call it  bullshit English writing. But just like sky using thunder to express  itself, land using river to express itself, I use my bullshit English  writing. Bullshit English writing is my watermark in English world. You  can not cover sound up from thunder, you can not wipe yellow off the  river, you can not take meaning from my bullshit English writing.</p>\n<p>I have no interesting in your perfect English grammar heaven  guaranteed by your stupid correctness pixel by pixel. Bullshit English  is fine. It is a part of mine, and you just can not take it down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fanfou.com/%E5%92%8C%E8%8F%9C%E5%A4%B4\" title=\"饭否\"><img alt=\"饭否\" src=\"http://b.fanfou.com/u/%E5%92%8C%E8%8F%9C%E5%A4%B4/s.png\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>鲜花总会长出来，不在墙这边相见，就在墙外面思念。请使用E-mail订阅《槽边往事》：</strong><a href=\"http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=caitou&#038;loc=en_US\">订阅地址</a></p>\n<p>国内访问地址：<a href=\"http://www.hecaitou.com/\">www.hecaitou.com</a></p>\n<p>饭否个人地址：<a href=\"http://fanfou.com/%E5%92%8C%E8%8F%9C%E5%A4%B4\">和菜头</a></p>\n</p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=738338\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"738338\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":337,"categories":[9203],"tags":[8772]}
