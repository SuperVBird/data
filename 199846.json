His mother, Donna Bella degli Abati, died when he was 5 or 6, and his father soon remarried Lapa Chiarissimo Cialuffi, who gave birth to two children: Francesco and Tana, Dante&#8217;s step-siblings. In his childhood Dante was home-schooled and studied many subjects &#8212; Tuscan poetry, painting and music among others. His passion for poetry grew and grew. By the time he was 18, Dante had met many famous artists: Guido Cavalcanti, Lapo Gianni, Cino da Pistoia and others. In 1285, when Dante was about 20, he married Gemma and had three sons with her: Jacopo, Pietro and Antonia. Though he became a father and husband, his young love for a girl named Beatrice, whom he admired from afar as a child, never ceased. He often called her his inspiration to his poems and mentioned her in his </p></blockquote>\n<p></span><i><span>Divine Comedy</span></i><span> of Hell, Purgatory and Heaven.</p>\n<blockquote></blockquote>\n<p>  </span></p>\n<p>但丁·阿利吉耶里生于1265年5月29日，卒于1321年9月14日。他的母亲贝拉·戴格利·阿巴缇夫人在他5、6岁上就过世了，他的父亲很快就再婚，娶了拉帕·恰里西莫·恰鲁菲，并生了两个孩子：弗朗西斯科和塔娜。但丁童年时在家接受教育，学习很多门功课——包括托斯卡纳方言诗歌、绘画和音乐。他对诗歌的热爱日渐增长。到他18岁时，但丁已经认识了很多著名的艺术家：包括吉多·卡瓦尔康蒂、拉普·吉亚尼、奇诺·德·皮斯托亚等人。1285年，20岁左右的但丁和杰玛结婚并育有三个儿子：雅各布、皮耶特罗和安东尼亚。尽管他已身为人夫人父，他对少年时曾远远倾慕过的一个名叫贝阿特丽齐的女孩的爱恋却从未止息。他常常把她称为他作诗的灵感，并在由《地狱篇》、《炼狱篇》、《天堂篇》组成的作品《神曲》中提到她。 </p>\n<p><span></p>\n<blockquote><p>At those times in Florence the people were separated into two groups: the rich and educated people, such as scholars and landowners, and the poor beggars and farmers. Though these people were living in the same city and at the same time, they spoke two different languages, which created a very distinct difference between the two classes. The poor spoke the Tuscany dialect while the rich spoke Latin. </p></blockquote>\n<p> </span></p>\n<p>在当时的佛罗伦萨，人被分成两类：富有的、受过教育的人，如学者和地主，以及贫穷的乞丐和农民。虽然这些人生活在同一座城市和同一个时代中，却说着两种不同的语言，这使两个阶级之间产生了明显的区别。穷人说托斯卡纳方言，而富人说拉丁语。</p>\n<p><span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Dante was born into a prominent family and was a great poet who came by his career writing in the language of the &#8220;rich,&#8221; but this is not what made him famous. After a long time of writing in Latin, Dante understood something very important, that Florentine culture wasn&#8217;t only made up of the educated and wealthy, which were only a small part of the population, but also the poor hard laborers. His poems were written for the people, and the people were EVERYBODY, so he started writing his works of art in the Tuscany dialect. After his breakthrough, many other poets began to write in the vulgar language (Tuscany dialect) and because the so-loved poems of the rich were now written in the language of the poor instead of Latin, the Tuscany dialect became the language belonging to EVERYBODY. The Tuscany dialect became what we now know as Italian.</p></blockquote>\n<p> </span></p>\n<p>但丁出身于显赫的家庭，是一名使用“富人”的语言写作而开启诗人生涯的大诗人，但这并不是使他出名的原因。在用拉丁文写作了很久之后，但丁明白了一件非常重要的事情——佛罗伦萨的文化并非只由仅占人口少数的受过教育的富人构成，还包括那些贫穷的体力劳动者。他的诗为人民而写，而人民应该是指所有的人，于是，他开始使用托斯卡纳方言创作自己的文学作品。在他的这一突破之后，许多其他的诗人也开始用平民的语言（托斯卡纳方言）写作，由于富人们如此喜爱的诗歌现在不再用拉丁文，而是用穷人们使用的语言写成，托斯卡纳方言就成为人人都使用的语言。托斯卡纳方言后来就发展成为如今我们所知的意大利语。 </p>\n<p><span></p>\n<blockquote><p>After the death of Beatrice, Dante&#8217;s life took a sudden turn. He began an intensive philosophical study of the Boethius, Cicero and Aristotle. Though he is mostly known for his poetry, wisdom and knowledge, Dante was also faithful to his Florence and joined the army in 1287 to take part in the Battle of Campaldino. He also became increasingly active in Florentine political affairs and, in 1295, he joined the citizen&#8217;s government known as the &#8220;Council of the Hundred.&#8221; But after a great debate, he and his council members were stripped of their property and banned from the City of Florence. Like all great artists, Dante felt differently and thought differently; his love and devotion for his city and Beatrice inspired him in his many artworks. He showed that he cared more for others and their good without thinking of the consequences, which brought about his exile. In all ways he was more than just a poet. </p></blockquote>\n<p> </span> </p>\n<p>贝阿特丽齐去世后，但丁的生活发生了突然的转变。他开始深入研究波伊提乌、西塞罗和亚里士多德的哲学著作。尽管他主要以诗歌、智慧和学识著称，但丁同时也效忠于家乡佛罗伦萨，并于1287年入伍参加了坎帕尔迪诺战役。他在佛罗伦萨的政治生活中也越来越活跃，1295年，他加入了市民政府“百人会议”。但在一场大争斗之后，他和其他会议成员被褫夺了财产并被逐出佛罗伦萨。同所有伟大的艺术家一样，但丁的感受和想法都与众不同；他对家乡和贝阿特丽齐的爱和忠诚激励他创作出许多作品。他的行为表现了他更关心他人及他人的利益，而不考虑这样做的后果，最终导致被放逐。从各方面说，他都不仅仅是位诗人。</p>\n<p><span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Dante Alighieri taught us many things, not only did he enlighten us with his fantastic poetry, but he also gave us a great understanding of the meaning of culture. Culture is EVERYBODY and EVERYBODY should be able to benefit from it! Like he said in the </p></blockquote>\n<p></span><i><span>Divine Comedy</span></i><span>: &#8220;O human race born to fly upward, wherefore at a little wind dost thou fall.&#8221; In a way he created the Italian language and that is why we call the Tuscan dialect &#8220;the true Italian.&#8221; Dante is a true hero in many ways and follows all the guidelines as he, in a way, fought for the rights of the poor. </span> </p>\n<p>但丁·阿利吉耶里教给我们许多事情，他不仅用他美妙的诗篇给予我们启迪，还教我们深刻理解文化的含义。文化属于每个人，每个人都应该能够从文化中获益！如同他在《神曲》中所说的那样：“啊，生来要向天空飞去的人类，风力太弱会使你坠落。”从某种程度上说，他创造了意大利语，这就是为什么我们把托斯卡纳方言称作“真正的意大利语”。但丁在很多方面都是位真正的英雄，并且在为争取穷人权利的奋斗过程中坚持了原则。</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www1.feedsky.com/t1/583841089/yeeyan-art/feedsky/s.gif?r=http://article.yeeyan.org/view/266133/235171\" border=\"0\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" /></p>\n</p>\n</p>\n</p>\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www1.feedsky.com/t1/583841089/yeeyan-art/feedsky/s.gif?r=http://article.yeeyan.org/view/266133/235171\" /></p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":993,"categories":[20534],"tags":[]}
