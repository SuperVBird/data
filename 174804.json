As the controversy continues in China over the<br />\nso-called “anti-rumor league,” a group of online rumor busters who have<br />\nadvertised themselves as truth-seeking vigilantes out to identify and<br />\nneutralize untruths in China’s burgeoning microblog sphere, this interview<br />\nprovides one of the best and most comprehensive looks at the question of what<br />\nconstitutes a “rumor” and how China can best use social media to promote<br />\nopenness, engagement and truth-seeking.</span></span></em></p>\n<p><em><span><span><br /></span></span></em></p>\n<p><em><b><span>Time<br />\nWeekly</span></b></em><strong><span>:</span></strong><span> Recently the<br />\nproblem of “rumors” on microblogs has become something of a concentrated<br />\nphenomenon and has drawn a lot of controversy. How should we view the<br />\nrelationship between rumor and microblogs? </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Hu<br />\nYong</span></strong><span>: Actually, rumors are a very old form of<br />\nlanguage, with a strong word-of-mouth character to them. In some sense, in the<br />\ninternet age we’ve seen the return you might say of some forms of communication<br />\nin the past. Microblogs particularly resemble village markets where everyone<br />\nmills around and the threshold for speaking is quite low. This kind of media<br />\nform is actually extremely suited to the spread of rumor and hearsay. The<br />\ntransmission chain is short, the speed rapid, and the scope wide. And so, it’s<br />\nfundamentally impossible to completely get rid of rumor on microblogs. </span></p>\n<p><em><b><span>Time<br />\nWeekly</span></b></em><strong><span>:</span></strong><span> Well then, owing to<br />\nthe special characteristics of microblogs, we can’t see all nonfactual<br />\ninformation as rumor. We need to separate “inaccurate information” (</span>错误的信息<span>) from “manufactured information” (</span>捏造的信息<span>),<br />\nin which the former is erroneous (</span>讹<span>) and the latter is<br />\nrumor (</span>谣<span>). But I’ve noticed that even some journalists<br />\ndon’t always differentiate between what is “erroneous” and what is “rumor,” but<br />\nsimply talk about all nonfactual information as “rumor.” </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Hu<br />\nYong</span></strong><span>: That’s right. This certainly happens,<br />\nand it’s important to recognize the difference. But we need to point out<br />\nfurther that if we simply define “rumor” as subjective and deliberate<br />\nfabrication (</span>主观故意的捏造<span>) and then add to this judgement<br />\nabout motives, this is really problematic. Put another way, the reason the<br />\n“anti-rumor league” has invited so much controversy is because many people<br />\nbelieve that they often make conjectures about the motives of those they focus on.</span></p>\n<p><span>People generally assume that rumor is fabrication, and then<br />\nsuppose that it involves some sort of nefarious purpose. It never occurs to<br />\nthem that rumor is not necessarily in and of itself pure fiction, that there<br />\nmight be a particle of truth. I’m personally very opposed to the idea of<br />\nascribing motive in the definition of rumor. We all know that the ascription of<br />\nmotive (</span>动机论<span>) or the attacking of others in argument on<br />\nthe basis of assumed motive (</span>诛心论<span>) have a longstanding<br />\nand well-established history in China. In the process of verbal exchange, or in<br />\nthe process of discourse and argumentation, we often don’t direct our language<br />\ntoward the conduct or language of the other, but rather directly criticize the<br />\nother — <em><span>why</span></em><br />\ndid they say what they did, <em><span>why</span></em> did they act in that way. We make conjectures about the<br />\nmotives of the other. This kind of motive ascription as a way of thinking is<br />\nactually the greatest obstacle to reasonable discussion, and in many cases its<br />\ninterest is actually throttling freedom of expression. </span></p>\n<p><em><b><span>Time<br />\nWeekly</span></b></em><strong><span>:</span></strong><span> This kind of form<br />\nof discussion that doesn’t ascribe motive should be a basic principle<br />\nestablished in public discussion on microblogs. I know that the French critic<br />\n[philosopher, sociologist] Raymond Aron placed great importance on this principle<br />\nand emphasized it again and again. He said that in collective action less<br />\nattention should be paid to the intention of those taking action and more<br />\nattention paid to the results of that action. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Hu<br />\nYong</span></strong><span>: We have a tradition of ascribing motive,<br />\nincluding during the Cultural Revolution when everyone talked about “literary<br />\nprostitutes” (</span>文痞<span>) [in accusing certain intellectuals].<br />\nWhat they used was what we often call the billy-club method. This method is in<br />\nfact one of the most commonly used forms of ascribing motive. If you ascribe<br />\nmotive excessively in your analysis of rumor, it is quite easy to wipe these<br />\nso-called rumors with your own ethical judgements and then occupy a moral high<br />\nground for yourself. When you use this sort of method to carry out a process of<br />\ndemonization on rumor, that actually means that what you’re wiping out is the<br />\nvalidity of the public’s questioning of you, or the validity of the public’s<br />\nresistance. In other words, I think that in the controversy over the<br />\n“anti-rumor league” there is something that has to be said clearly, and that is<br />\nthat the notion of “dispelling rumor” [<em><span>piyao</span></em>] does not have natural validity<br />\nwithin the context of contemporary China. </span></p>\n<p><em><b><span>Time<br />\nWeekly</span></b></em><strong><span>:</span></strong><span> The “anti-rumor<br />\nleague” and the motive-ascribing form of thought that they represent is<br />\nsomething we have to be alert to and critical of. We can also see that if we<br />\nlump what is said in error with rumor, this kind of thought demands that people<br />\nhave to be all-knowing, and this expects far too much of people. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Hu<br />\nYong</span></strong><span>: In a basic sense, any time something<br />\nhappens information is asymmetrical, and no one is like God, seeing and knowing<br />\nall. So oftentimes information will emerge incomplete or even in error, and its<br />\ndifficult to dismiss it directly as “rumor.” In a deeper sense, rumor is one<br />\nway and means by which we come to recognize our society, a form of knowing (</span>认知方式<span>). Because as an individual or community when you meet with<br />\nuncertainty you will naturally undergo acts of social cognition, or you’ll act<br />\nin a collective manner, working to eliminate uncertainties in the information<br />\nprocess. In the research of rumor, social scientists believe that rumors are in<br />\nan important sense part of social cognition, a tool with which social<br />\ncommunities resolve problems. </span></p>\n<p><em><b><span>Time<br />\nWeekly</span></b></em><strong><span>:</span></strong><span> Yes. Information,<br />\nthis basic concept, has been defined as something that dispels the cognitive uncertainties<br />\nof the receiver. For example, the July 23 accident [of the high-speed train in<br />\nWenzhou], this sudden-breaking incident, created a great deal of uncertainty.<br />\nAt the same time it also generated a craving for accurate and timely<br />\ninformation. But the government was extremely negligent in providing<br />\ninformation about the disaster, and even had a desire to cover it up. So then,<br />\nrumors in the sense that you just described them emerged. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Hu<br />\nYong</span></strong><span>: That’s right. On this issue a lot of<br />\npeople have a very superficial understanding, and perhaps have a lot of warped<br />\nviews. As I just said, we can make a distinction within rumors about truthful<br />\ncontent and fictional content. But many people believe that rumors must all<br />\nnaturally be false. What’s more, a great many people believe that rumors are a<br />\nform of social malady. And so we see even a lot of media saying metaphorically<br />\nthat rumors are spreading like an illness. In fact, some of the actions of the<br />\n“anti-rumor league” have this sort of problem.</span></p>\n<p><span>When you understand “rumor” purely as a kind of sickness,<br />\nyou commit an error of presumptuous arrogance, assuming that the public<br />\nconsists of people who easily fall victim to illness, that they easily believe<br />\nrumors and lightly disseminate them. But in fact as we just discussed, rumors<br />\nare a normal part of society, a normal condition, and not a sickness.<br />\nFunctional rumors will emerge among communities in our society as they seek<br />\nanswers to events that they cannot explain. </span></p>\n<p><em><b><span>Time<br />\nWeekly</span></b></em><strong><span>:</span></strong><span> So once we<br />\nunderstand the function that rumors have, how do we understand “rumor busting”<br />\norganizations like the “anti-rumor league” on microblog platforms? Actually,<br />\nI’d rather replace the strongly suggestive term “rumor-bust” with “clarify.”</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Hu<br />\nYong</span></strong><span>: The “anti-rumor league” says itself that<br />\nit wants to take on social responsibility in the era of We Media (</span>自媒体<span>), leveraging spontaneous forces to promote self-discipline in<br />\nspeech. This follows the pattern of self-governing organizations in the We<br />\nMedia age, but the problem lies chiefly in the way as everyone has criticized<br />\nthey selectively target rumors, avoiding government rumors and only focusing on<br />\nrumors from the public. They say themselves that they are bearing a social<br />\nresponsibility, but we can see from the microblog account of the founder of the<br />\n“anti-rumor league,” Dou Hanzhang (</span>窦含章<span>), that he has<br />\nlabeled himself as someone who “speaks on behalf of the government” (</span>替政府说话的人<span>). This tells us quite clearly that he has a position. In my view,<br />\nto target popular rumor and avoid official rumor is a failure of intelligence,<br />\nwhether it’s an active attempt at cover up or passive neglect. In sum, they<br />\nhave overlooked a relationship, I call it the relationship between rumors and<br />\nlies.<br />\n[Earlier coverage in Chinese of Dou and his affiliations:<br />\nhttp://news.cn.yahoo.com/ypen/20110809/517859.html]</span></p>\n<p><span>The slogan of the “anti-rumor league” is, “Serving the<br />\nTruth” (</span>为真相服务<span>). Well then, we then have to ask, under<br />\nChina’s present circumstances what is the biggest obstruction to the truth? Is<br />\nit lies, or is it rumors? This is a question they must answer. </span></p>\n<p><em><b><span>Time<br />\nWeekly</span></b></em><strong><span>:</span></strong><span> In the microblog<br />\nsphere, the “anti-rumor league” has been subjected to widespread challenge [by<br />\nusers], and you might say it has even become the proverbial rat crossing the<br />\nroad [which everyone hates and abuses]. But objectively speaking, microblogs<br />\nare in need of a mechanism for clarification, or an information settlement<br />\nplatform (</span>信息澄清平台<span>). What form would you hope this would<br />\ntake, or what kind of people would constitute such a thing? </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Hu<br />\nYong</span></strong><span>: As to the mechanisms of clarification, I<br />\nthink we can say as the ancients did that “the art lies outside the poetry” (</span>功夫在诗外<span>). Which is to say we cannot just focus on microblogs and ask what<br />\nthe best mechanism for clearing up [information] is. In fact, the best possible<br />\nmechanism for clearing up [information] would be for the government to realize<br />\nopenness and transparency of information, would be to resolve the problem of<br />\nlies that we just touched on. After that, it’s about the media doing fair and<br />\ncomprehensive reporting. </span></p>\n<p><span>As a form of media, microblogs naturally have their own<br />\ncapacity for self-correction, because many people participate in microblogs and<br />\nevery person has their own strengths, information sources and social network,<br />\nand sometimes these people may be on the scene [to give eyewitness accounts],<br />\netcetera. This is something traditional media often cannot accomplish. This<br />\nkind of assembling could possibly lead to the emergence of a group<br />\nintelligence. And this group intelligence is in fact what constitutes the<br />\nmechanism of self-correction in the microblog sphere. This is one of the great<br />\nsources of vitality for microblogs. </span></p>\n<p><em><b><span>Time<br />\nWeekly</span></b></em><strong><span>:</span></strong><span> Still, some people<br />\nmay be concerned that this sort of self-correcting mechanism is not necessarily<br />\ncomplete. Is it possible that it might have systematic flaws, or have<br />\ncollective blind spots? </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Hu<br />\nYong</span></strong><span>: This actually boils down to the question<br />\nof how you regard group thinking (</span>群体思维<span>). There has<br />\nalways been different views about this. One view is the one we’ve already<br />\ntalked about, the view that groups can give rise to intelligence and that this<br />\nintelligence corrects through exchange. But there has always been another<br />\nunderstanding and view that says that if individuals gather into groups the<br />\nintelligence represented by those groups will not necessarily be superior to<br />\nindividual intelligence, or even will not just not give rise to group<br />\nintelligence but will instead give rise to crowd foolishness (</span>群体的愚蠢<span>). There are many examples used to support this view, for example<br />\nHitler’s Germany, China during the Cultural Revolution, etcetera.
