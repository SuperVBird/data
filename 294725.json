This new law, passed after an extensive<br />\nperiod of preparation and regional experiments, established the<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.infzm.com/content/84614\">Network Real Name System</a>. Internet<br />\naccess providers must now require their customers to provide their real names<br />\nand legitimate identifications in order to sign up for internet service, mobile<br />\ninternet access, or to register on a blog or other website. Service providers<br />\nare also responsible for monitoring and preventing illegal activities by users.</span></p>\n<p><span>Details regarding the law’s implementation are still being<br />\ndiscussed at local and national levels. The task is proving to be difficult as<br />\nlegislators are unsure how to supervise internet access providers and how to<br />\ndecide exactly what actions are illegal. The decision itself does not provide<br />\nthe regulatory guidelines necessary, nor does it allow access providers to make<br />\ntheir own judgments regarding the handling of sensitive user information.</span></p>\n<p><span>This new decision legalized internet content censorship and<br />\nreinforces the obligation of internet service providers (ISPs) to report user<br />\nactions to the authorities. Article Five provides that ISPs should strengthen<br />\nthe management of users when they post information online. When illegal or<br />\nprohibited information is found online, ISPs are to stop transmitting<br />\ninformation and begin taking their own initiatives such as deleting or<br />\ncensoring information, storing related records, and then reporting the<br />\ninformation to a relevant department of government.</span></p>\n<p><span>The decision has increased the power of Chinese ISPs to block,<br />\nintercept, discriminate, and prohibit users’ right to access information on the<br />\nInternet. It may also prohibit users’ right to transmit information, software,<br />\nlawful service and initiatives. The decision also implies that government has<br />\nfurther shared supervising responsibility with internet access providers, which<br />\nmay be called “privatization of supervision.” This privatization of enforcement<br />\ncreates concern that individual internet users may be punished for activities<br />\nnot only by the government, but also by their ISPs.</span></p>\n<p><span>The decision to remove anonymity from internet activities stems<br />\nin part from the association between Internet criminal activity and anonymity.<br />\nIndividuals who create viruses, junk emails, scams, and start political rumors<br />\nrely on anonymity to avoid consequences.</span></p>\n<p><span>On the other hand, this association is also constructed<br />\npurposefully by the authorities. For instance, a commentary on the front page<br />\nof People’s Daily on Dec 18</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span><span> </span></span><span>2012, “Internet Is<br />\nNot Outside of Law,” warned internet users to be cautious in terms of their<br />\nexpressions. The commentary implied that, due to the increasing reach and<br />\nsimplicity of internet use, individuals act carelessly without thinking about<br />\npossible outcomes with online actions and statements that are subject to the<br />\nlaw.</span></p>\n<p><span>In early 2012, microblogging services (called<span> </span>Weibo<span> </span>in China) mandated that all account<br />\nholders use their full names, causing an uproar among users. The Director of<br />\nthe</span><span> </span><span>State<br />\nInternet Information Office, Wang Chen, explained that, “microblogging has<br />\nchanged the pattern of public opinion in China, but it is also easy to make<br />\nsome irrational voices and negative public opinion and harmful information to<br />\nspread rapidly.”</span></p>\n<p><span>According to statistics, 150 million<span> </span>Weibo<span> </span>posts are made in China on a daily<br />\nbasis. How many of them are “irrational voices, negative public opinion and<br />\nharmful information?” While real name registration might limit the activities<br />\nof pornography disseminators, liars, and false evidence planters, it also<br />\ninfringes upon the rights of the majority of users.</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s true that anonymity has its drawbacks, but the value it<br />\ngenerates balances out its costs. Governments should not try to limit<br />\nanonymity; it would be better for internet communities to determine anonymous<br />\nsystem based on their preferences and functions.<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Release-2-0-Esther-Dyson/dp/0767900111/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1362500235&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=release+2.0\">Esther<br />\nDyson’s book<span><span> </span></span>Release 2.0</a><span> </span>lists many potential reasons users may<br />\nprefer to remain anonymous, which include discussing personal problems, testing<br />\nout new identities, or questioning an unfair system.</span></p>\n<p><span>Over-monitoring from the government is a threat to netizen<br />\nrights in China. This decision may lead to<span> </span>violation<br />\nof privacy, identity theft, or a violation of freedom of speech as guaranteed<br />\nby China’s own constitution.</span></p>\n<p><span>An editorial in The Global Times<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/NEWS/tabid/99/ID/689239/Netizens-fears-of-new-real-name-system-misplaced.aspx\">argued<span><span> </span></span></a>that it is unnecessary to worry<br />\nthat these regulations will prevent individuals from using the internet to<br />\nreveal corruption or criticize the government, because Chinese citizens have<br />\nbecome increasingly vocal and less fearful. Yet, Chinese citizens have still<br />\nexpressed anger and concern regarding the new legislation. For example, veteran<br />\ninternet observer</span><span> </span><span>Xie Wen, </span><span>remarks:</span></p>\n<p><i><span> “People are just saying that corruption will ruin the<br />\nparty and the state, then there emerges a voice that internet will ruin the<br />\nparty and the state; people are just saying that we should strengthen the<br />\nsupervision of government power, then somebody wants to strengthen the<br />\nsupervision of the internet; people are just saying that officials should make<br />\ntheir assets public, then some departments are making netizens’ names public …<br />\nwho is going against the flow?”</span></i><span></span></p>\n<p><span>There exists a conflict between the need for social transparency<br />\nand the right for individual privacy and anonymous speech. Anonymity is<br />\nactually related to the tolerance of society: the ability to embrace diversity<br />\nand the possibility of personal spaces. Increasingly, a great deal of private<br />\nbehavior is now highly visible via the internet, forcing us to question the<br />\nextent to which society is able to tolerate these privacy violations.</span></p>\n<p><span>What the government attempts to execute with regard to<br />\ncyberspace is control-based law rather than rights-based law. In the past, the<br />\ngovernment always exerted control in the name of “protection”. For instance,<br />\nthe infamous Green Dam Youth Escort filtering program, which the government<br />\nattempted to implement in 2009, attempted to control users’ security, privacy,<br />\ninformation flow and right of selection under the cover of “protecting<br />\njuveniles from pornography.”</span></p>\n<p><span>The difference between rights-based law and control-based law is<br />\nvery simple: if it is a rights-based law, it is designed to restrict<br />\ngovernment—it does not allow government to rule without limitations; if it is a<br />\ncontrol-based law, then it is designed to restrict netizens – it limits the<br />\nscope of free expression. “Restrict government first” is the basic principle<br />\nfor a society governed by rule of law; government power is supervised and<br />\nregulated, while civil rights are maintained and protected. However, until now,<br />\nnearly all the cyber laws and regulations in China are control-based.</span></p>\n<p><span>During the legislative process, there was no channel for<br />\ncitizens to participate in the decision making process. The official mass media<br />\nhas always endorsed non-transparent and non-democratic legislation, and this<br />\ncase is no exception. Prior to the final decision, official mass media<br />\npropagated that “netizens asked for legislation to protect network<br />\ninformation.”</span></p>\n<p><span>The decision is not based on public consultation or consent, and<br />\nits purpose is to control, not protect, citizens’ rights and interests.</span></p>\n<p><span>//Dr. Hu Yong, an associate professor at the School of<br />\nJournalism and Communication at Peking University, is a new media critic.</span><span></span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=b4fd4ae247\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/mstlf\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[5908,16912,8923]}
