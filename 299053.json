CHAN</span><span> 06/11/13 09:03 PM<br />\nET EDT </span><span></span><span></span></p>\n<p><span>HONG KONG &#8212; Edward Snowden, the<br />\nformer CIA employee who leaked top-secret documents about U.S. surveillance<br />\nprograms, has few options to stay one step ahead of the authorities while in<br />\napparent hiding.</span></p>\n<p><span>One possibility is to seek asylum in a place that does not have<br />\nan extradition pact with the United States &#8212; there are a few in Asia a short<br />\nflight away from Hong Kong where he was last spotted, but none where he is<br />\nguaranteed refuge.</span></p>\n<p><span>On Tuesday the 29-year-old Snowden&apos;s whereabouts were unknown, a<br />\nday after he checked out of a trendy hotel in the Chinese territory of Hong<br />\nKong. But large photos of his face were splashed on most Hong Kong newspapers<br />\nwith headlines such as &#8220;Deep Throat Hides in HK,&#8221; and &#8220;World&apos;s<br />\nMost Wanted Man Breaks Cover in Hong Kong.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>The coverage is likely to increase the chances of him being<br />\nrecognized although he could still blend with the city&apos;s tens of thousands of<br />\nexpatriates from the United States, Britain, Australia and Europe.</span></p>\n<p><span>If and when the Justice Department charges him – and it&apos;s not<br />\ncertain when that will be – its next step will likely be to ask the<br />\nInternational Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, for a provisional<br />\nrequest to arrest him pending extradition to the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span>Assuming that Snowden is still in Hong Kong, the judicial<br />\nproceedings for an extradition request could take a year, and once completed it<br />\nwould be up to Hong Kong&apos;s leader, known as the chief executive, to decide on<br />\nhanding over Snowden, said Michael Blanchflower, a Hong Kong lawyer with three<br />\ndecades of experience in extradition cases.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Ultimately it is his decision,&#8221; he said.</span></p>\n<p><span>But even if the chief executive allows the extradition, the<br />\nfugitive can request a judicial review and those decisions could be appealed up<br />\nthrough three court levels, Blanchflower said.</span></p>\n<p><span>Although a semiautonomous part of China, the former British<br />\ncolony has an independent justice system based on the British legal structure.</span></p>\n<p><span>One option for Snowden would be to claim he is the object of political<br />\npersecution, and fight the issue in the courts to avoid extradition. He could<br />\nargue that he would be subject to cruel and humiliating treatment in the United<br />\nStates. Hong Kong changed its regulations six months ago to require that a court<br />\nconsider cruel and humiliating treatment and not simply torture when<br />\nconsidering extradition requests.</span></p>\n<p><span>It&apos;s up to &#8220;the Chief Executive to determine whether the<br />\noffence is one that&apos;s of a political character, in which case the extradition<br />\nis blocked,&#8221; said Hong Kong-based lawyer, Tim Parker.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, the strategy carries considerable risk because the U.S.<br />\ncould simply provide diplomatic assurances that he would not be subject to<br />\ncruel or humiliating treatment.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;At that point it would be difficult for Hong Kong to<br />\nresist deporting him,&#8221; said Patricia Ho, a Hong Kong lawyer who<br />\nspecializes in asylum and refugee claims.</span></p>\n<p><span>But as things stand now, there is nothing to prevent Snowden<br />\nfrom traveling to a destination of his choice &#8212; to one of the handful of nearby<br />\njurisdictions or countries that do not have extradition treaties with the<br />\nUnited States.</span></p>\n<p><span>One of the Asian countries without an American treaty is China,<br />\nthough there is no guarantee Beijing would want to risk a confrontation with<br />\nthe United States by taking Snowden in, even if it gained a windfall of<br />\nsensitive American intelligence information in the process. Snowden himself has<br />\ngiven no indication that he is prepared to cooperate with any foreign<br />\nintelligence service, including China&apos;s.</span></p>\n<p><span>China&apos;s state media has confined its coverage of the Snowden<br />\naffair to factual reports, and on online social media, China&apos;s relatively<br />\nunfettered venue for public discourse, comments have been largely muted.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;People in China are used to not having security and<br />\nprivacy on the internet, so this does not come as a big surprise,&#8221; Peking<br />\nUniversity journalism professor Hu Yong said in an interview. Official media,<br />\nHu said, would &#8220;try not to focus too much on how wrong the practice is, or<br />\nwhether the leaker is right or wrong. They will use the news to highlight that<br />\nChina is not the only country with such practices.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>Another Asian flight possibility for Snowden is the<br />\nself-governing island of Taiwan, which split from China in 1949 after a<br />\nprotracted civil war, and since 1979, has not had formal diplomatic relations<br />\nwith the U.S.</span></p>\n<p><span>In lieu of a formal extradition treaty, American extraction<br />\nrequests to Taiwan are examined on a case by case basis.</span></p>\n<p><span>An official at the de facto U.S. Embassy in Taipei – the<br />\nAmerican Institute in Taiwan – said Taiwan has generally been cooperative on<br />\nthe extradition issue.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Taipei has so far been pretty good on responding to our<br />\nrequests,&#8221; the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because<br />\nof the sensitivity of the issue.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also, any attempt by Snowden to come to Taiwan could prove<br />\nextremely embarrassing to the government of Ma Ying-jeou, which while doing its<br />\nbest to improve relations with China, also seeks to maintain close ties with<br />\nthe United States, its major security backer. An official at the Justice<br />\nMinistry said Tuesday there were no indications at all that Snowden would make<br />\nany attempt to land on the island.</span></p>\n<p><span>Aside from numerous flights from Hong Kong&apos;s busy international<br />\nairport, Snowden could take an hour-long high speed ferry ride to Macau, also a<br />\nsemiautonomous region of China. From Macau he could hop over to Guangdong<br />\nprovince in mainland China.</span></p>\n<p><span>Beyond Taiwan and China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and North Korea<br />\nare also theoretical destinations for Snowden, because they lack extradition treaties<br />\nwith the U.S. But the communist or authoritarian systems they share make them<br />\nunlikely destinations for a man who has gone to considerable lengths to portray<br />\nhis decision to reveal National Security Agency surveillance programs as an act<br />\nof conscience.</span></p>\n<p><span>Outside of Asia, Snowden might also consider seeking asylum in<br />\ncountries like Iceland and Russia. According to the Kommersant Daily, Moscow<br />\nhas said it might provide asylum. But Russia is also an authoritarian nation,<br />\nso there is no guarantee that Snowden would accept any offer that Moscow<br />\nrendered.</span></p>\n<p><span>__</span></p>\n<p><span>Enav reported from Taipei, Taiwan.
