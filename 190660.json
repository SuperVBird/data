He is also a civil rightsactivist and helped in drawing international attention to humanrights issues in rural areas of China. After talking to </span></span></span><span><span><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>Time</i></span></span></span><span><span><span lang=\"en-US\">magazine about the forced abortion cases in Shandong Province, theauthorities arrested him under the accusation of </span></span></span><span><span><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>destructionof property and assembling a crowd to disrupt traffic</i></span></span></span><span><span><span lang=\"en-US\">(which is a frame in order to get an innocent man into jail). He wassentenced to four years and three months in prison.</span></span></span></span></span></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><span><span lang=\"en-GB\"><span><span><span lang=\"en-US\">Afterhe was released, Chen GuangCheng was put under House Arrest by thegovernment for no reason. Chen and his wife, along with their sixyear old daughter, are forbidden to leave their house. Securityguards make sure that no one can come and visit the family. Manyattempts of supporters have been made to visit Chen and his family,however they were turned away by force, threatened, robbed, and insome cases beaten severely. </span></span></span></span></span></div>\n<div><span><span lang=\"en-GB\"><span><span><span lang=\"en-US\"> </span></span></span></span></span></div>\n<div><span><span lang=\"en-GB\"><span><span><span lang=\"en-US\">Chen’sten year old son is forced to live with relatives in order tocontinue schooling. He is only allowed to see his family once a year,on New Year’s Eve. Chen’s six year old daughter who was supposedto start First Grade was rejected from the school. Even though she isnow able to attend school, four to five ‘bodyguards’ place herunder strict supervision by following her to all her classes. Thegirl is not allowed to play with others, she is not allowed to comeinto contact with others, toys and books sent to her from friendswere all taken away.</span></span></span></span></span></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><span><span lang=\"en-GB\"><span><span><span lang=\"en-US\">Thefamily remains under house arrest to this day.</span></span></span></span></span></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><span><span lang=\"en-GB\"><span><span><span lang=\"en-US\">Allthis was done, because a blind lawyer spoke out against the interestsof the Chinese Government. The government has no reason to place theChen family under house arrest. They have no right to cut a six yearold girl away from society. Nor should they separate a ten year oldboy from his family. </span></span></span></span></span></div>\n<div><span><span lang=\"en-GB\"><span><span><span lang=\"en-US\"> </span></span></span></span></span></div>\n<div><span><span lang=\"en-GB\"><span><span><span lang=\"en-US\">Thiscampaign is called </span></span></span><span><span><span lang=\"en-US\"><i><b>DarkGlasses.
