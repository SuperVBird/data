While the ban is part of government efforts to block &#8220;unofficial<br />\ninformation&#8221; it says threatens social stability, observers say that the<br />\napproach could backfire. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;The<br />\ngovernment tends to delete blog posts when rumors are widely circulating, which<br />\nends up attracting more attention to them. It only leads the public to believe<br />\nthe deleted posts are accurate,&#8221; wrote Hu Yong, associate professor at<br />\nPeking University&#39;s School of Journalism and Communication, in his study<br />\n&#8220;Rumor as social protest.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>A survey conducted<br />\nby the Hong Kong based Phoenix News Media Inc in October on why China had been<br />\nflooded with rumors found that 55% of respondents believed the government&#8217;s<br />\nlack of transparency led the public to disseminate and believe rumors or<br />\nunofficial information, while 32% believe the country&#8217;s blocked information channels<br />\nwere the cause. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Rumors have<br />\nexisted as long as human beings. The Internet is just the activator,&#8221; said<br />\nZhou Yuqiong, associate professor at Shenzhen University&#39;s Mass Communication<br />\nCollege, &#8220;Reality is the best enemy of rumor,&#8221; says Zhou, who points<br />\nout the Internet rumors about HIV/AIDS have almost disappeared in the three<br />\nyears since public discussions about the disease became more common. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Unofficial<br />\ninformation in China can take different forms. Recently, state-run media<br />\nmistakenly reported on a fake government document, a development some might<br />\nargue lends the new laws credibility. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>On July 27, the<br />\n&#8220;State Administration of Taxation&#39;s Notice 47, 2011&#8221;, a circular<br />\nexplaining new personal income tax rules in China, was posted on the social<br />\nmedia website, Tianya. About two weeks later, China&#39;s state-run Xinhua News<br />\nAgency, China Central Television (CCTV) and others all reported the new rules<br />\nstated in the document. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>But, three days<br />\nlater, the State Administration of Taxation said it had never issued such a<br />\ncircular. At the end of October, Shanghai Public Security Bureau&#39;s website<br />\nannounced a 15-day-detention for a netizen online-named &#8220;Piplet&#8221;, a<br />\ntemporary resident in Shanghai&#39;s Minhang district, for fabricating Notice 47.<br />\nAccording to the police website, Piplet&#39;s real surname was Li. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Shortly after the<br />\nincident, the Chinese Communist Party&#39;s Central Committee concluded its sixth<br />\nplenum with a call for a tighter media control, including strengthening<br />\n&#8220;guidance and management&#8221; of social networking and instant-messaging<br />\napplications, punishing the spread of &#8220;harmful&#8221; materials online, and<br />\npromoting better security to &#8220;uphold public interests and national<br />\nsecurity.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>In order to<br />\ncontrol Internet usage, China has introduced some 20 regulations and assigned<br />\nmultiple police departments to monitor websites in their districts, even though<br />\nChinese President Hu Jintao told Chinese netizens in June 2008 that &#8220;the<br />\nweb is an important channel for us to understand the concerns of the public and<br />\nassemble the wisdom of the public&#8221;. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>According to the<br />\nTelecommunications Regulations introduced in September 2000, no organization or<br />\nindividual is allowed to produce or reproduce information with content that<br />\nspreads rumors, disturbs social order or disrupt social stability, harms the<br />\ndignity or interest of the state and compromise state security or damage<br />\nnational unity, without providing any specific definition of many of these<br />\nvague terms. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Violating the<br />\nregulations constitutes a crime and would be subject to criminal investigation,<br />\naccording to the Decision Preserving Computer Network Security of the Standing<br />\nCommittee of the National People&#8217;s Congress (NPC), China&#8217;s parliament. The<br />\ngovernment has also increased pressures on website operators, who are not only<br />\nrequired to keep a close watch on netizens&#8217; activities but also held<br />\nresponsible for rumor circulation. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Sina.com, one of<br />\nChina&#8217;s most popular websites, set up a team to verify suspicious information<br />\nposted on its website last year. The team is entitled to punish those who<br />\nspread inaccurate information on the website by suspending their accounts, but<br />\nsome netizens compare the process to an online lynching. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Huang Xuamin, one<br />\nof the founders of Wenzhou&#8217;s 703804.com, a website once famous for disclosing<br />\ninformation about corrupt government officials, said his company has been<br />\nworking with the local police on monitoring netizens&#8217; activities on the website<br />\nfor years. The local police, he said, could directly delete any items they<br />\nthink are sensitive. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Still, the vague<br />\nlaws give the government more rights to interpret on its own. The government<br />\nhas deleted many blog posts or messages that it considers<br />\n&#8220;sensitive,&#8221; or &#8220;rumors&#8221;. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>In September, a<br />\nblog called Huguoshan General Secretary that exposed the luxurious watches worn<br />\nby local government officials became popular among netizens. But the blog was<br />\nswiftly removed. (See China begins to watch out, Asia Times Online, September<br />\n30, 2011) </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>The government&#39;s<br />\ntighter rules, meanwhile, have frustrated Chinese netizens. In responding to<br />\nthe latest announcements, a netizen called Wang Gang posted a note on Sina.com<br />\nsaying &#8220;People who fabricate rumors shouldn&#39;t enjoy the right to suppress<br />\nrumors. When the truth is only known by a small group, no reality can be<br />\nfound,&#8221; said one. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;It is not<br />\npossible for a country to hold high moral standards when it has a propaganda<br />\ndepartment in operation,&#8221; said Bright moon rising above the sea. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Based on Zhou&#8217;s<br />\nanalysis, some netizens do deliberately fabricate information to provoke the<br />\ngovernment to come up with more accurate answers. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Other rumors this<br />\nyear include false reports in July of former paramount leader Jiang Zemin&#8217;s<br />\ndeath, as well as reports this month that a Yunnan citizen dying of cancer had<br />\nmurdered eight village officials and claims that a J-10B fighter aircraft had<br />\ncrashed during a test flight. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>According to the<br />\nShanghai Public Security Bureau, which publicizes online the names of people<br />\nand websites that violate the Internet laws, Piplet was detained for 15 days<br />\nfor fabricating a government circular, without elaborating which law the<br />\nblogger has actually violated. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Piplet didn&#8217;t<br />\nrespond to interview requests submitted via his or her Tianya account. The<br />\nShanghai police also declined interview requests over their Internet monitoring<br />\nwork and Piplet&#8217;s case. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Some netizens and<br />\nChinese reporters, meanwhile, remain suspicious about whether the circular was<br />\nreally fabricated and whether Piplet really exists, arguing Notice 47 might<br />\nhave indeed been a leaked government document draft. They question why the<br />\nState Administration of Taxation took longer than 48 hours to clarify the report.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Rumors run<br />\nthe wildest in a no-information society. The strengths of rumors grow more<br />\npowerful when a government covers-up and manipulates information more<br />\nfrequently,&#8221; said Peking University&#39;s Hu Yong said in his research paper. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Yvonne Su is a<br />\nfreelance journalist based in Beijing. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>(Copyright 2011<br />\nAsia Times Online (Holdings) Ltd.
