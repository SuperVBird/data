What was Mr Biden&#8217;s sin? Was it Mr Biden&#8217;s suggestion that<br />\ncreative thought is stifled in China?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<span><br />\nYou cannot think different in a nation where you<br />\ncannot breathe free. You cannot think different in a nation where<br />\nyou aren&#8217;t able to challenge orthodoxy, because change only comes<br />\nfrom challenging orthodoxy.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<span><br />\nNo, that wasn&#8217;t it.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span><br />\nThe source of the insult is a surprising one: Mr Biden called China<br />\na &#8220;great nation&#8221;, and a &#8220;nation&#8221; repeatedly after<br />\nthat. </span>Victor Mair, the resident sinologist<br />\nat the Language Log blog, translates Mr Zhang&#8217;s<br />\ncomplaint.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\nIn this sentence, &#8220;You CANNOT think different in a nation where you<br />\naren&#39;t able to challenge orthodoxy&#8221;, he used the word &#8220;nation&#8221;.<br />\nThis is what really infuriated me, because in English &#8220;nation&#8221;<br />\nindicates &#8220;race, ethnicity&#8221;, which is different from &#8220;country,<br />\nstate&#8221;. &#8220;Country, state&#8221; perhaps places more emphasis on the notion<br />\nof the entirety of the country, even to the point of referring to<br />\nthe idea of government. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nMr Mair explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\nThe weakness in Zhang&#39;s reasoning lies mainly in his confusion over<br />\nthe multiple meanings of the word mínzú 民族&#8230;. [M]ínzú 民族 can mean<br />\n&#8220;ethnic group; race; nationality; people;<br />\nnation&#8221;.  Coming from the English side, we must<br />\nkeep in mind that &#8220;nation&#8221; can be translated into Chinese as guó 国<br />\n(&#8220;country&#8221;), guójiā 国家 (&#8220;country&#8221;), guódù 国度 (&#8220;country; state&#8221;),<br />\nbāng 邦 (&#8220;state&#8221;), and, yes, mínzú 民族 (&#8220;ethnic group; race;<br />\nnationality; people; nation&#8221;).</p>\n<p>\nIt is clear that, when Biden said &#8220;China is a great nation&#8221;, he was<br />\nrespectfully referring to the country as a whole. <br />\nYet the sensitivity to questions of ethnicity in China, especially<br />\nwith regard to the shǎoshù mínzú 少数民族 (&#8220;ethnic / national<br />\nminorities&#8221;), e.g., Uyghurs, Tibetans, and scores of others, caused<br />\nZhang to take umbrage over something that the Vice President never<br />\nintended.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nI leave it to Mr Mair and the Chinese-speaking commenters to<br />\ndiscuss the ins and outs of <em>mínzú</em>.<br />\nBut the confusion lies partly on the English side of things.<br />\nEnglish-speakers use &#8220;nation&#8221; in a way unmoored from how it is used<br />\nin other western countries, not to mention differently<br />\nfrom <em>mínzú.</em></p>\n<p>\nPolitical scientists talk about &#8220;nations&#8221; carefully. The word<br />\nrefers to the—partly artificial—notion of a people who share a<br />\nlanguage, history, religion, ethnicity and culture. When nations<br />\nawake, become self-aware as nations, and seek their own state, that<br />\nis <em>nationalism</em>.<br />\nAnd a nation that succeeds in getting its own state has<br />\na <em>nation-state</em>.<br />\n </p>\n<p>\nThe concept is very European. The French are the<br />\ncanonical &#8220;nation&#8221;, even if this identity is more<br />\nconstructed and less ancient than most Frenchmen realise. The first<br />\ndefinition for the modern sense of &#8220;nation&#8221; in the Académie<br />\nFrançaise&#39;s dictionary is that of the political scientists:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<span><br />\nEnsemble de personnes établies sur un territoire<br />\net unies par des caractères ethniques, des traditions<br />\nlinguistiques, religieuses, etc. [Collection of persons established<br />\non a territory and united by ethnic charcteristics, linguistic and<br />\nreligious traditions, etc.]</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nIn this traditional European understanding, the Germans are a<br />\nnation. The Russians are a nation. Many European languages have a<br />\nword that encapsulates this concept. For the French it is of<br />\ncourse <em>nation</em><span> </span>itself;<br />\nfor the Germans, <em>Volk</em>,<br />\nfor the Russians, <em>narod</em>.<br />\nIn all of these languages, the nation is distinct from the country<br />\n(<em>pays,<br />\nLand </em>or <em>strana</em>)<br />\nand most definitely from the state (<em>état,<br />\nStaat, gosudarstvo</em>). We see the quasi-familial connection of<br />\nthe nation to its territory in terms<br />\nlike <em>patrie,<br />\nVaterland </em>and <em>rodina</em>,<br />\nall from &#8220;parental&#8221; etymological roots. All of these words mean<br />\nslightly different things to different people in these countries,<br />\nand they change over time. For example, the<br />\nFrench <em>peuple </em>partly<br />\noverlaps with <em>Volk/narod</em>.<br />\nAnd the Soviets used <em>narod </em>to<br />\nrefer to the new &#8220;Soviet nation&#8221;, and <em>natsionalnost&#39; </em>to<br />\nrefer to nationalities like Russians, Kazakhs, Jews and so forth.<br />\nBut the point remains: the people/<em>Volk</em>/nation<br />\nis a prominent and powerful concept in European thinking. As a<br />\nmetaphor, it has more in common with a blood-related family than<br />\nwith a group of like-minded people living together by<br />\nchoice.</p>\n<p>\nThings got confusing when new kinds of states began to appear.<br />\nSmall mixed groups of people from Europe established footholds in<br />\nthe Americas—among a population of indigenous Americans—and then<br />\nstarted importing slaves and later accepting immigrants from all<br />\naround the world. These new societies were hardly &#8220;nations&#8221; in the<br />\ntraditional European sense, with a shared history, ethnicity,<br />\nculture, language, religion and the like.  Some of<br />\nthese things, of course, were shared among much of the population,<br />\nbut by no means all. In the United States, &#8220;Americanness&#8221; (for<br />\nidealists, at least) came to mean belief in American civic ideals;<br />\na kind of nation of the mind. Much the same happened in places like<br />\nCanada, Brazil and Australia, with their linguistically and<br />\nracially mixed populations. Each of these places, today, has a<br />\nstrong identity. But it does not rest on the old European idea of<br />\nthe nation, a single people with a single story. Some political<br />\nscientists cleverly introduced the idea of the &#8220;state-nation&#8221;, a<br />\ncommunity that came into existence because of the prior existence<br />\nof a distinct state. France is a nation-state; Brazil, a<br />\nstate-nation.</p>\n<p>\nBut political scientists have no power to determine how ordinary<br />\npeople use words. And in America, &#8220;nation&#8221; is now used broadly,<br />\nmore or less as a synonym for &#8220;country&#8221;. Politicians are very fond<br />\nof it in particular. A search of the<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/home/LegislativeData.php?&#038;n=Record&#038;c=112\">Congressional<br />\nRecord for the 112th Congress</a><span> </span>(2011-2012) maxes<br />\nout at 2000 results for the phrase &#8220;our nation&#8221;.

The official version of the story is that<br />\nAmerican-born citizen has as simple a claim on the American<br />\nidentity as any other. The questioning of Barack Obama&#8217;s<br />\nAmericanness, on so many grounds, shows that this is premature<br />\nself-congratulation. If there is such thing as an American nation,<br />\nit is a complicated one.</p>\n<p>\nSo not even English-speakers agree on the basket of concepts<br />\n&#8220;nation&#8221; should include. And English-speakers are far more<br />\nwide-ranging in their use of &#8220;nation&#8221; then Europeans are with their<br />\nloaded words like <em>Volk </em>and <em>narod</em>.<br />\nThis seems to have been the same conceptual mismatch that confused<br />\nMr Zhang in his response to Mr Biden. Though he was graduating from<br />\nan elite English-language university, he missed this subtlety of<br />\n&#8220;nations&#8221; in the course of his education. In that, he is like many<br />\nof the Americans graduating with him. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>\n拜登演讲视频<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNTYxMzk3NDI4.html\">http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNTYxMzk3NDI4.html</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"http://simg.sinajs.cn/blog7style/images/special/1265.gif\" /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sina.allyes.com/main/adfclick?db=sina&#038;bid=204720,469641,474922&#038;cid=0,0,0&#038;sid=473458&#038;advid=358&#038;camid=37389&#038;show=ignore&#038;url=http://qing.blog.sina.com.cn/tag/%E5%86%99%E7%9C%9F\">青春就应该这样绽放</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sina.allyes.com/main/adfclick?db=sina&#038;bid=204720,469645,474926&#038;cid=0,0,0&#038;sid=473464&#038;advid=358&#038;camid=37389&#038;show=ignore&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Funion.9173.com%2Fpub%3Fp%3D1%26u%3D1008\">游戏测试：三国时期谁是你最好的兄弟！！</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sina.allyes.com/main/adfclick?db=sina&#038;bid=204720,469646,474927&#038;cid=0,0,0&#038;sid=473465&#038;advid=358&#038;camid=37389&#038;show=ignore&#038;url=http://qing.blog.sina.com.cn/tag/%E6%98%9F%E5%BA%A7\">你不得不信的星座秘密</a><img src=\"http://sina.allyes.com/main/adfclick?db=sina&#038;bid=204720,470173,475454&#038;cid=0,0,0&#038;sid=474001&#038;advid=358&#038;camid=37389&#038;show=ignore&#038;url=http://simg.sinajs.cn/blog7style/images/common/sg_trans.gif?t=0\" /></p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"450\" height=\"309\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=2ea93c5b7b\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/msuvD\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[5908,8339,17986,9400]}
