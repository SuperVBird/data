Yet, they have tried their very best to keep it.</p>\n<p>Every Wednesday, many Tibetan people in Minnesota, just like other people in the world, will dress, eat, speak and act in Tibeatn Style, to remind them that they are Tibetan.</p>\n<p>All Tibeatn people will have their Green Book issued by CTA to remind them that they are Tibetan. Anywhere they travel, they will keep the Green Book in their hands.        </p>\n<p>Conculsion: Present Economic Conditions in Minnesota<br />\nThe per capita personal income in 2008 was $42,772.
