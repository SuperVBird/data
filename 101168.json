Christopher Bell. Gregory Steven Brock. Kenneth Allan<br />\nChapman. Robert Clark. Charles Timothy Davis. Cory Davis. Michael<br />\nLee Elswick. William I. Griffith. Steven Harrah. Edward Dean Jones.<br />\nRichard K. Lane. William Roosevelt Lynch. Nicholas Darrell<br />\nMcCroskey. Joe Marcum. Ronald Lee Maynor. James E. Mooney. Adam<br />\nKeith Morgan. Rex L. Mullins. Joshua S. Napper. Howard D. Payne.<br />\nDillard Earl Persinger. Joel R. Price. Deward Scott. Gary Quarles.<br />\nGrover Dale Skeens. Benny Willingham. And Ricky Workman.</p>\n<p>Nothing I, or the Vice President, or the Governor, none of the<br />\nspeakers here today, nothing we say can fill the hole they leave in<br />\nyour hearts, or the absence that they leave in your lives. If any<br />\ncomfort can be found, it can, perhaps, be found by seeking the face<br />\nof God &#8212; (applause) &#8212; who quiets our troubled minds, a God who<br />\nmends our broken hearts, a God who eases our mourning souls.</p>\n<p>Even as we mourn 29 lives lost, we also remember 29 lives lived.<br />\nUp at 4:30 a.m., 5:00 in the morning at the latest, they began<br />\ntheir day, as they worked, in darkness. In coveralls and hard-toe<br />\nboots, a hardhat over their heads, they would sit quietly for their<br />\nhour-long journey, five miles into a mountain, the only light the<br />\nlamp on their caps, or the glow from the mantrip they rode in.</p>\n<p>Day after day, they would burrow into the coal, the fruits of<br />\ntheir labor, what so often we take for granted: the electricity<br />\nthat lights up a convention center; that lights up our church or<br />\nour home, our school, our office; the energy that powers our<br />\ncountry; the energy that powers the world. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>And most days they’d emerge from the dark mine, squinting at the<br />\nlight. Most days, they’d emerge, sweaty and dirty and dusted from<br />\ncoal. Most days, they’d come home. But not that day.</p>\n<p>These men -– these husbands, fathers, grandfathers, brothers<br />\nsons, uncles, nephews -– they did not take on their job unaware of<br />\nthe perils. Some of them had already been injured; some of them had<br />\nseen a friend get hurt. So they understood there were risks. And<br />\ntheir families did, too. They knew their kids would say a prayer at<br />\nnight before they left. They knew their wives would wait for a call<br />\nwhen their shift ended saying everything was okay. They knew their<br />\nparents felt a pang of fear every time a breaking news alert came<br />\non, or the radio cut in.</p>\n<p>But they left for the mines anyway -– some, having waited all<br />\ntheir lives to be miners; having longed to follow in the footsteps<br />\nof their fathers and their grandfathers. And yet, none of them did<br />\nit for themselves alone.</p>\n<p>All that hard work, all that hardship, all the time spent<br />\nunderground, it was all for the families. It was all for you. For a<br />\ncar in the driveway, a roof overhead. For a chance to give their<br />\nkids opportunities that they would never know, and enjoy retirement<br />\nwith their spouses. It was all in the hopes of something better.<br />\nAnd so these miners lived -– as they died -– in pursuit of the<br />\nAmerican Dream.</p>\n<p>There, in the mines, for their families, they became a family<br />\nthemselves -– sharing birthdays, relaxing together, watching<br />\nMountaineers football or basketball together, spending days off<br />\ntogether, hunting or fishing. They may not have always loved what<br />\nthey did, said a sister, but they loved doing it together. They<br />\nloved doing it as a family. They loved doing it as a community.</p>\n<p>That’s a spirit that’s reflected in a song that almost every<br />\nAmerican knows. But it’s a song most people, I think, would be<br />\nsurprised was actually written by a coal miner’s son about this<br />\ntown, Beckley, about the people of West Virginia. It’s the song,<br />\nLean on Me -– an anthem of friendship, but also an anthem of<br />\ncommunity, of coming together.</p>\n<p>That community was revealed for all to see in the minutes, and<br />\nhours, and days after the tragedy. Rescuers, risking their own<br />\nsafety, scouring narrow tunnels saturated with methane and carbon<br />\nmonoxide, hoping against hope they might find a survivor. Friends<br />\nkeeping porch lights on in a nightly vigil; hanging up homemade<br />\nsigns that read, “Pray for our miners, and their families.”<br />\nNeighbors consoling each other, and supporting each other and<br />\nleaning on one another.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen it, the strength of that community. In the days that<br />\nfollowed the disaster, emails and letters poured into the White<br />\nHouse. Postmarked from different places across the country, they<br />\noften began the same way: “I am proud to be from a family of<br />\nminers.” “I am the son of a coal miner.” “I am proud to be a coal<br />\nminer’s daughter.” (Applause.) They were always proud, and they<br />\nasked me to keep our miners in my thoughts, in my prayers. Never<br />\nforget, they say, miners keep America’s lights on. (Applause.) And<br />\nthen in these letters, they make a simple plea: Don’t let this<br />\nhappen again. (Applause.) Don&#8217;t let this happen again.</p>\n<p>How can we fail them? How can a nation that relies on its miners<br />\nnot do everything in its power to protect them? How can we let<br />\nanyone in this country put their lives at risk by simply showing up<br />\nto work; by simply pursuing the American Dream?</p>\n<p>We cannot bring back the 29 men we lost. They are with the Lord<br />\nnow. Our task, here on Earth, is to save lives from being lost in<br />\nanother such tragedy; to do what must do, individually and<br />\ncollectively, to assure safe conditions underground &#8212; (applause)<br />\n&#8212; to treat our miners like they treat each other &#8212; like a family.<br />\n(Applause.) Because we are all family and we are all Americans.<br />\n(Applause.) And we have to lean on one another, and look out for<br />\none another, and love one another, and pray for one another.</p>\n<p>There’s a psalm that comes to mind today -– a psalm that comes<br />\nto mind, a psalm we often turn to in times of heartache.</p>\n<p>“Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I<br />\nwill fear no evil, for You are with me; your rod and your staff,<br />\nthey comfort me.”</p>\n<p>God bless our miners. (Applause.) God bless their families. God<br />\nbless West Virginia. (Applause.) And God bless the United States of<br />\nAmerica. (Applause.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img alt=\"President Obama Offers Condolences at Upper Big Branch Service\" height=\"365\" src=\"http://dulei.si/files/19ac336b2440a4919f340cb0a18af4dd.jpg\" width=\"560\" /></p>\n<p>President Barack Obama comforts family members of the 29 victims<br />\nof the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion during a memorial service in<br />\nBeckley, W.Va., April 25, 2010.
