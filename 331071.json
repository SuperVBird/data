His 16 supporters, who were detained for protesting against his detention, have since been released, but Karma Tsewang remains behind bars. Karma Tsewang has been detained at the Changdu (Chomdo) County Detention Centre, Tibet Autonomous Region, since 6 December, after he was seized in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, while travelling on business. His family have attempted to visit him several times, but have not been allowed. He suffers from hepatitis, and although his family were able to give some medication to officers at the detention centre, it is not known whether these were given to him and whether he is getting all the treatment he requires.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Karma Tsewang is the highly-regarded abbot (Khenpo) at the Gongya Monastery in Nangqian (Nangchen) county, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, in Qinghai Province. On 10 December, after his detention, over 600 people including monks from Gongya Monastery staged a demonstration in Nangqian, calling for his release. Officials at Nangqian county threatened the monks who took part in the demonstration, warning them that Karma Tsewang would face even more severe punishment if they did not stop their protests. Despite stopping the demonstration, on 20 and 21 December, 16 monks were detained. They have since been released without charge.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Karma Tsewang’s lawyer Tang Tianhao said he is being held on suspicion of “endangering state security’, but what this relates to has not been confirmed. This provision in Chinese Law is frequently used by the authorities to imprison peaceful critics of the government and curtail freedom of expression. Karma Tsewang’s detention comes at a time when Tibetan monks continue to be the target of a crackdown by the Chinese authorities, following the mass protests in 2008.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Please write immediately in English, Chinese or your own language:  Urging the authorities to ensure Karma Tsewang has regular access to his family, lawyers of his choosing, and any medical treatment he may require;  Calling on the authorities to ensure Karma Tsewang is not tortured or ill-treated.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>PLEASE SEND APPEALS BEFORE 5 MARCH 2014 TO: Director of Tibet Autonomous Region Public Security Bureau Li Zhao Tingzhang Xizang Zizhiqu Gong&#8217;anting 26 Linkuodonglu Lasashi 850000 Xizang Zizhiqu People’s Republic of China Salutation: Dear Director</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Director of Qinghai Province Public Security Bureau Liu Zhiqiang Tingzhang Qinghaisheng Gong&#8217;anting No. 50 Bayilu, Chengdongqu Xiningshi 810007 Qinghaisheng People’s Republic of China Fax: +86 971 8293290 Email: ghosthotcat@qhga.gov.cn</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Salutation: Dear Director And copies to: Premier Li Keqiang Guojia Zongli The State Council General Office 2 Fuyoujie, Xichengqu Beijingshi 100017 People’s Republic of China Fax: +86 10 65961109 Email: kf@people.cn</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Also send copies to diplomatic representatives accredited to your country.

Gongya Monastery is an important monastery in Nangqian with 300 monks, 200 nuns and 100 young monks. The monastery holds the annual Grand Prayer for World Peace Puja which attracts tens of thousands of Tibetan Buddhist followers each year.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Since the Tibetan mass protests of 2008 against Chinese rule, the Chinese government has stepped up repression in Tibetan areas and imposed intrusive military and security controls on the local people. The authorities also continue to subject Tibetans to humiliating &#8220;patriotic education&#8221;, which forces them to denounce the Dalai Lama and express support for the Chinese Communist Party. Tibetan monks have been a primary target of the crackdown. According to the International Campaign for Tibet, as of 19 December 2013, 125 Tibetans have self-immolated since 27 February 2009 in protest against this crackdown.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Name: Karma Tsewang Gender m/f: Male</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Further information on UA: 4/14 Index: ASA 17/002/2014 Issue Date: 22 January 2014</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>（转自：<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/002/2014/en/850d3a02-0db1-4a0d-89b5-78960a254cc1/asa170022014en.html\">http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/002/2014/en/850d3a02-0db1-4a0d-89b5-78960a254cc1/asa170022014en.html</a>）</div>\n</p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdtimes/index.html?u=chinese\">中国数字时代亚马逊镜像</a>（墙内可直接点击）</p>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[9400,8951,8643]}
