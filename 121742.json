Instead, Beijing has pulled out all the stops to make the<br />\nprize about almost anything but human rights. If that tactic<br />\nsucceeds—and if the rest of the world isn&#8217;t careful, it might—this<br />\nprize will represent a disappointing lost opportunity.</p>\n<p>The committee&#8217;s purpose ought to be clear as day: Mr. Liu won<br />\nthe prize &#8220;for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental<br />\nhuman rights in China.&#8221; Yet in the weeks since the announcement,<br />\nBeijing has framed this as an attack on its &#8220;sovereignty.&#8221; It also<br />\nsparked a debate about commercial interests and diplomacy toward<br />\nChina by cancelling a ministerial trade meeting with Norway and<br />\ncalling upon European countries to boycott the award ceremony or<br />\nelse. More destructively, China&#8217;s state-run media launched an<br />\nunprecedented campaign to slander and libel Mr. Liu and intimidate<br />\nhis many supporters by suggesting he&#8217;s in the pay of the American<br />\ngovernment and harbors &#8220;anti-China&#8221; opinions.</p>\n<p>In short, Beijing has tried to change the subject in order to<br />\ndistract commentators from human rights problems that Mr. Liu<br />\naddressed and that the Nobel committee wanted to highlight.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there will soon be another opportunity to get the<br />\ndiscussion back on track: the Dec. 10 ceremony at which Mr. Liu<br />\nwould personally receive his medal if he weren&#8217;t currently<br />\nimprisoned for 11 years. The best way to cut through Beijing&#8217;s<br />\nsmokescreen is to focus not only on Mr. Liu but also on why his<br />\nfriends won&#8217;t be able to attend the ceremony either.</p>\n<p>Liu Xia, Mr. Liu&#8217;s wife, would ordinarily be the guest of honor<br />\nin his absence. Unfortunately, since announcement of the prize,<br />\neven though she is not suspected of a crime, she has been subjected<br />\nto increasingly severe police restraints, making it very difficult<br />\nto communicate with the outside world. Thus, on Oct. 26, when a<br />\nforeign journalist asked Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu what<br />\nMr. Ma called a &#8220;hypothetical question&#8221;—whether Liu Xia would be<br />\nallowed to go to Oslo—Mr. Ma was able confidently to urge<br />\njournalists to ask her whether she wanted to go.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the renowned criminal defense lawyer Mo Shaoping and<br />\noutspoken Peking University law professor He Weifang, both<br />\nsignatories of Charter 08, were prevented from leaving the country.<br />\nThey were on their way to a conference of the International Bar<br />\nAssociation in London, scheduled months ahead. They already held<br />\nNovember return tickets and had no plans to go to Oslo. Yet the<br />\nauthorities told them they were not allowed to leave, because they<br />\n&#8220;might endanger state security.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Consider also blind &#8220;barefoot lawyer&#8221; Chen Guangcheng, who has<br />\nbeen invited to attend. He probably doesn&#8217;t even know he is on the<br />\nguest list. Since his release from prison on Sept. 9 after serving<br />\nmore than four years for &#8220;intentionally damaging public property&#8221;<br />\nand &#8220;organizing others to block traffic&#8221; (his real crime was<br />\nrevealing the local government&#8217;s massive forced abortions and<br />\nsterilizations), he and his family have been under extraordinarily<br />\nfierce extralegal detention. Their impoverished rural farmhouse is<br />\nat all times encircled by a horde of police officers and hired<br />\nguards, who have severed all communications, installed security<br />\ncameras and all-night bright lights, and frequently threatened Mr.<br />\nChen as well as would-be visitors. The last any of his friends<br />\nspoke to him or his wife was in late September.</p>\n<p>Hu Jia is another friend of Mr. Liu who will not be able to<br />\nhonor him in Oslo. Mr. Hu is serving a 3½-year prison sentence for<br />\n&#8220;inciting to subvert state power,&#8221; related to his activism on<br />\nbehalf of the environment, AIDS-related official abuses, persecuted<br />\nhuman rights defenders and others. His wife, also an activist, has<br />\nbeen warned that upon his release in 2011 the family, which endured<br />\nillegal harassment before Mr. Hu&#39;s detention, will likely be<br />\nsubjected to the same sort of suffocating illegal house arrest that<br />\ntheir friends the Chens have long suffered.</p>\n<p>Another activist illegally detained in his apartment is former<br />\nShanghai housing lawyer Zheng Enchong. He helped expose a corrupt<br />\nconspiracy between Shanghai officials and private developers who<br />\nevicted local residents to make way for building projects. It first<br />\ncost him his lawyer&#8217;s license. He then was sent to prison for three<br />\nyears, ostensibly for sending abroad &#8220;state secrets&#8221; but actually<br />\nbecause he persisted in advising the dispossessed. He has been<br />\nholed up by police for most of the last four years and is now<br />\nstrictly confined again after sending out messages supporting Liu<br />\nXiaobo.</p>\n<p>At least the whereabouts of these activists are known. That is<br />\nnot the case with another unfrocked lawyer who will not be in Oslo<br />\non Dec. 10, Gao Zhisheng, one of China&#8217;s most courageous<br />\nhuman-rights defenders, who has been kept under house arrest,<br />\nharassed, imprisoned, tortured and humiliated since 2006. At<br />\npresent he has literally &#8220;been disappeared&#8221;—authorities won&#8217;t say<br />\nwhether he is in jail again and, if so, why; or where he is; or<br />\neven if he is still alive. And this is not his first disappearance.<br />\nEarlier this year, after sustained efforts on his behalf by foreign<br />\ngovernments, human rights organizations and media, Mr. Gao emerged<br />\nfor one week of limited freedom following 14 months of<br />\ndisappearance. Yet, after contacting his wife and children, who<br />\nfled to the U.S. last year, and a few friends, he again went<br />\nmissing and there has been no news of him since April 20.</p>\n<p>Foreign politicians, diplomats, journalists, business people,<br />\nacademics and rights activists should be asking Beijing why these<br />\npeople and many other admirable Chinese invitees won&#8217;t be allowed<br />\nto travel to Norway. Such sunlight might burn off some of the fog<br />\nthe Chinese government has tried to create around its civil and<br />\npolitical rights record. There is no better way to answer Beijing&#8217;s<br />\ndiversionary nationalistic propaganda offensive than to call<br />\nattention to those empty chairs on Dec. 10.</p>\n<p><em>Mr. Cohen is codirector of New York University School of<br />\nLaw&#8217;s U.S.-Asia Law Institute.
