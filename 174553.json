But considering that I wrote quite a number of commentaries on my own blog and for various media, I feared I might make carping remarks or get all twisted up, so I wrote off the idea. However, a number of trends in Chongqing of late are nagging causes for anxiety. In my view, the various things that have happened in that city already pose a danger to the most basic notions of a society ruled by law. And as a legal scholar, one in particular who has participated in the process of judicial reform, I believe I now have an urgent duty to openly express my uneasiness and voice my criticisms.</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Another factor behind my writing of this open letter is the fact that Chongqing is the locale of my alma mater, Southwest University of Political Science and Law, and a city of which I have the fondest memories. It was there in 1978, after a</span> <span>“<span lang=\"EN-US\">long a arduous journey,</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">that I began my sojourn into legal studies in that campus at the foot of Gele Hill.</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In the course of our studies that year, our teachers too had only just returned to campus life after the</span> <span>“<span lang=\"EN-US\">terrible decade</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">during which they were suppressed, and they spoke of the lawless days of the Cultural Revolution, chapter upon chapter of misery and suffering. A number of teachers could not hold back the tears. Actually, all of us students had also experienced the Cultural Revolution first-hand, and all of us one way or another treasured this course of study in law. We longed for the future of building rule of law in our homeland, and we all hungered for the opportunity to get involved in this great project, doing our part to preserve civil rights and freedom. We made up our minds that we would not allow the tragedy of the Cultural Revolution to be replayed on this soil.</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Now, thirty years have passed, and so many things have happened in this city with which we are so intimately familiar, things that cause one to feel that time has been dialed back, that the Cultural Revolution is being replayed, and that the ideal of rule of law is right now being lost. That</span><span>’<span lang=\"EN-US\">s right, I</span>’<span lang=\"EN-US\">m pointing to the</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">campaign of crackdown on criminal forces</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">(</span>打黑除恶<span lang=\"EN-US\">) that has been going on [in Chongqing] for two years now (and of course also about this business of</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">singing red songs,</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">though I</span>’<span lang=\"EN-US\">ll set this issue aside for now).</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Throughout this whole</span> <span>“<span lang=\"EN-US\">campaign against crime</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">(</span>打黑<span lang=\"EN-US\">) we have seen the furious unfolding of movement-style (</span>运动式<span lang=\"EN-US\">) law enforcement and administration of justice. Within a short eight months, the authorities rounded up close to 5,000</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">criminally involved</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">(</span>涉黑<span lang=\"EN-US\">) persons by means of informing (or so-called</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">letters and denunciations by the masses</span>”<span lang=\"EN-US\">). Along with this we had one-hundred or so</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">special case teams</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">(</span>专案组<span lang=\"EN-US\">) making assaults are carrying out wholesale arrest, prosecution and trial proceedings with so-called</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">Chongqing speed</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">(</span>重庆速度<span lang=\"EN-US\">).</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">As the diary of Judge Wang Lixin (</span><span>王立新<span lang=\"EN-US\">), posted to the official website of the Supreme People</span>’<span lang=\"EN-US\">s Court ahead of the hearing of the Wen Qiang case (</span>文强案<span lang=\"EN-US\">) on appeal, clearly shows, police, prosecutors and the courts [in Chongqing] worked in concert, preparing cases without any separation of responsibilities. It</span>’<span lang=\"EN-US\">s not just this, but so-called</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">three chiefs conferences</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">(</span>大三长会议<span lang=\"EN-US\">) have actually appeared too. For a number of important cases, the chief judge, the attorney-general and the police chief will hold meetings and work in a coordinated fashion, so that the cases decided before they ever even go to trial. The eventual hearing of the case is a mere formality. The institutional goal of allowing the three branches to mutually check one another is entirely for naught. My colleagues, do you not believe that these methods run entirely counter to the independent exercise of adjudicative and procuratorial powers clearly stipulated in our nation</span>’<span lang=\"EN-US\">s Constitution and Criminal Procedure Law?</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In the midst of trial proceedings for the Li Zhuang case (</span><span>李庄案<span lang=\"EN-US\">), we saw quite clearly that the most basic neutrality of the court had already vanished. During the trial, Li Zhuang and his defense attorney requested that witnesses appear in court to be cross-examined. I have no doubt that Judge Fu Mingjian (</span>付鸣剑<span lang=\"EN-US\">), who officiated at the trial, understands only too well the importance of face to face cross-examination, because the topic of his research paper at Southwest University of Political Science and Law was on the necessity of witnesses appearing in court for cross-examination. But the collegiate bench [of judges in Chongqing] rejected the request of the defendant, citing as its reason that witnesses were unwilling to appear in court. Please, won</span>’<span lang=\"EN-US\">t you all consult your Criminal Procedure Law to see whether or not court appearances by witnesses are determined by the principal of willingness? Seeing as the seven key witnesses in this case are in the custody of law enforcement in Chongqing, the written statements they have provided might have been made under coercion or for gain, and their testimony must be checked in person. Only then can it really be determined whether or not Li Zhuang instigated other in providing false testimony. Nevertheless, the court in Jiangbei District</span> — <span lang=\"EN-US\">this is where I studied in my university years</span> — <span lang=\"EN-US\">arrived at a guilt verdict in the case on the basis only of this so-called testimony there is no way of verifying.</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In the midst of the hearing on appeal of this case, something extremely strange happened: Li Zhuang, who had firmly denied his guilt in the first trial, suddenly entirely admitted his guilt. We are powerless to get to the bottom of the reasons behind this dramatic shift, but when the court announced that, owing to his confession, Li Zhuang</span><span>’<span lang=\"EN-US\">s sentence would be reduced to 18 months from 30 months, Li Zhuang clearly bore the marks of humiliation and anger of one hoodwinked, and he shouted out:</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">My confession is fake. I hope the court does not handle me according to this plea bargain, as my confession was induced by the Chongqing Public Security Bureau and prosecutors</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">(see report from Economic Observer Online, February 9, 2010). Li Zhuang</span>’<span lang=\"EN-US\">s words show that he had not admitted guilt.</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">. . .</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The problem is, supposing the legal world did not cooperate, how could these judicial dramas be perpetuated? Those who are participating might make excuses and say that they personally harbor doubts or even resist in their hearts, but how can you resist such overwhelming power? Admittedly, this is a very tangled problem. But there is still a clear line between passive obedience and active bootlicking. It is chilling the way some prosecutors with strict legal training have disregarded basic concepts of law, creatively endorsing various illegal actions. And it can be said that this is a sign of the failure of legal education [in our country].</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Here I must especially express my feelings of disappointment with a number of law professors in the Chongqing. If the case in professional circles is such that owing to their professional roles they have no choice but to listen to their superiors, it is entirely within the power of these scholars to maintain at least a most minimal degree of independence. As for this trampling on basic standards of rule of law, you perhaps do not wish to directly voice your criticism, but you at least have the right to remain silent. The history of law in many countries shows that, in terms of protecting basic standards of rule of law, one important mission of scholars within the legal field is to provide theoretical support and reinforcement for professionals working in the field. At the same time, they have a sacred duty, as [German jurist] Rudolf von Jhering said, to</span> <span>“<span lang=\"EN-US\">struggle for the law. Against intrusions on judicial independence, violations of legal procedure, and conduct damaging civil rights and freedom, scholars must issued clear and firm criticism and opposition. But regrettably, a number of my colleagues [in the legal world] have failed to do this. Quite the contrary, even before the verdict in the first instance came out, they were all singing in unison in official government newspapers, saying things that were completely at odds with the five procedural rules. You can all see online how various people commented [on the case], doing damage to the dignity of academia and especially the dignity of Southwest University of Political Science and Law. I can</span>’<span lang=\"EN-US\">t for the life of me understand. What motivated these colleagues to act this way?</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Finally, I have a few words for Chongqing</span><span>’<span lang=\"EN-US\">s police chief, Wang Lijun (</span>王立军<span lang=\"EN-US\">). In November 2010, you were given a concurrent post as a director of doctoral students at Southwest University of Political Science and Law. As it happens, I too am a director of doctoral students at the University. So at this point I may as well engage a fellow scholar in a bit of conversation. While you are only chief of police, your role has become quite prominent and you are a person of real consequence in light of the fact that authorities in Chongqing have given the</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">campaign against crime</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">such a high level of priority. I harbor a number of concerns about the thunderbolt that is this movement you are spearheading. First, if the guiding principle contains hints of social purification, the result could be quite dangerous. There are always aspects of human nature that cannot be changed, and a healthy society can perhaps only take an attitude of tolerance toward certain human weaknesses. There is an inherent tension between order and freedom, and if order is emphasized too strongly, then freedom will suffer in the balance.</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Second, while we all bitterly hate criminal elements, and we encourage dealing with criminal activity in accordance with the law, we must also recognize that for</span> <span>“<span lang=\"EN-US\">black society</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">[criminal gangs] to have developed in Chongqing to the terrifying degree you so enjoy declaring, this must surely mean that serious problems have emerged in</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">white society</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">[or &#8220;clean society&#8221;]. As justice has faltered, for example, enterprises have had to rely on means outside the law to ensure the safety of business. While campaigning against criminal elements is necessary, dealing with the problem at its root means building the relevant systems to ensure that government administration accords with the law and the courts are just.</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Third, assuming that in the process of meting out justice the government employs means that are illegal, such as extraction of confession by torture, violating suspects</span><span>’ <span lang=\"EN-US\">rights in litigation, or even intimidating lawyers for the defense in criminal cases, the future consequences of this will be serious. Employing illegal means to strike out against illegal elements leaves people with the unfortunate impression that might is right, that black can be used to deal with black. Moreover, excessively severe penalties upset the expectation people have for equal treatment, and this breeds pent up anger among the family members of those already found guilty, and the guilty who might one day be released from prison, fostering a frightening anti-social force. For many years, we</span>’<span lang=\"EN-US\">ve seen that the perpetrators of many of the most grievous crimes [in our society] were those viciously treated in previous</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">strike hard</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">campaigns [against crime] and then released at the end of the terms. Having been in law enforcement for so many years, you must be even more clear about this than I am.</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span> </span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Fourth, even though under the current system, police organs have power surpassing that of the courts, I am confident you must understand as a director of doctoral students, that one important measure of rule of law in a country is the limiting of police power by the courts. Police must respect the courts, and they must accept the independent examination and supervision of prosecutors, and must protect the independence of courts and judges. Actually, respect for judicial independence is just as important for those who hold major power in their hands. While he was still in favor, Wen Qiang (</span><span>文强<span lang=\"EN-US\">) no doubt had little idea of the value of this independence, but once he had fallen afoul of the authorities, he must have had a rude awakening, realizing only too well that without judicial independence no one at all is safe.</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">My colleagues, as I write this letter, I think from time to time of death. While relevant numbers have not been completely released, since the</span> <span>“<span lang=\"EN-US\">campaign against crime</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">was initiated [in Chongqing], aside from Wen Qiang, there have been many people in Chongqing who have been sentenced to death. Death comes to us all, but for the state to deprive a person of his life is a grave matter. I saw pictures on the internet of the city organizing citizens in the singing of</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">red anthems.</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">Red banners fluttered in the wind, red as far as the eye could see. The color of these flags is also the color of blood. The</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">singing of red anthems</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">and the</span> “<span lang=\"EN-US\">campaign against black</span>” <span lang=\"EN-US\">[or crime] are bathed in a common color, and one cannot suppress all sorts of complicated memories. Nevertheless, whether one is on top for a time, or lives in ignominy, death will visit us all in the end. Those criminals sentenced to capital punishment will only go there sooner than the rest [in such a system without the protection of laws]. Decapitations and firing squads leave behind dreadful scars, and the trauma is without a cure. The ancient Greek playwright Sophocles recognized this only too clearly. Let me use his words, then, to close this letter:</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">No ceremony, no wedding songs, no dances and no songs</span><span>…</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Just death! The end of us all is death.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The best would be not to be born at all.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">But then, if he is born, the next best thing for him would be to try and return</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">to where he came from in the quickest possible time!</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">While youth and its careless mind lasts, no thought is given to what pain, what</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">misery will, most certainly, follow.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Murder, mayhem, quarrels, wars will come before the inescapable end.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The hateful old age, frailty, loneliness, desolation and</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">your own misery</span><span>’<span lang=\"EN-US\">s neighbour, is even more misery.</span></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">I wish you all happiness, and offer a salute to rule of law.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">April 12, 2011</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">NOTE: The author invites the media to run the text of this letter online, and I extend the invitation particularly to Chongqing media.
