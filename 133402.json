As Twitter-like<br />\nsocial media spreads, the number of virtual bystanders has<br />\ngrown exponentially.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>When two sisters were bullied by officials in Nanchang, their<br />\nplight was broadcast and seen by close to millions through such social<br />\nmedia.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The online onlookers did more than look. They shared the<br />\nsisters&#39; story with their networks, enabling the tale to spread so fast<br />\nthat censors could not catch up.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>WHAT HAS CHANGED</span></b><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>What had changed, wrote Dr Hu in a column, is that these social<br />\nmedia, or micro-blogs as they are known in China, have lowered the risk<br />\nand cost of participation. </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>It does not require anything heroic. Virtual onlookers just need<br />\nto click their mouse and share the story, in the comfort of their homes.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Micro-blogs can add up to something big, Dr Hu believed.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>A common Chinese saying goes: &#8216;What man is doing, heaven is watching.&#8217;</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Perhaps one can now say: What the powerful in China are doing,<br />\nthe netizens are watching.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>While it’s uncertainly unwise to exaggerate the Internet’s impact,<br />\nit has for sure made many officials watch their backs. Or maybe<br />\ntheir wrists.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>As Zhou Jiugeng, an ex-property bureau chief, would know, a branded watch<br />\nglimpsed online may mean an end to one’s career.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Back in 2008, the most popular Internet neologism in China was<br />\n&#39;da jiang you&#39;, which means literally to go buy soy sauce. It was a<br />\ncheeky rejoinder to mean, &#39;I’m just passing by and it’s none of my business&#39;.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>A man in Guangzhou had famously offered soy sauce as an excuse when<br />\nhe declined to be interviewed.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Will the Internet make the Chinese less of a nation of &#39;soy<br />\nsauce buyers&#39;? Especially when all that’s asked of them is that they<br />\nclick their mouse?</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Well, we’d all have to watch and find out.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<h4>要翻墙? <a href=\"http://9293.biz\">用赛风</a>.</h4>\n","author":176,"categories":[9203],"tags":[8800]}
