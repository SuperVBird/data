Huntsman Jr.  United States Ambassador to China from 2009 to 2011.<br />\n薄熙来Bo Xilai<br />\n薄瓜瓜Bo Guagua<br />\nMs. Livingston<br />\nthree others present at the dinner.</p>\n<p><strong>故事1，洪博培的故事：</strong><br />\nBo Guagua, arrived one evening last spring at the home of the United States ambassador to pick up one of the ambassador’s daughters for a dinner date. He was supposedly wearing a tuxedo and driving a red Ferrari.</p>\n<p>这个版本是法拉利故事原始版本。纽约时报声明由洪大使自己讲述，大使馆有至少有两人2011年4月从洪博培听到这个故事。</p>\n<p><strong>故事2，薄熙来的故事：</strong><br />\nMr. Bo Xilai gave a news conference at the annual National People’s Congress in Beijing, saying “a few people have been pouring filth on Chongqing and me and my family” and called the Ferrari story “sheer rubbish.”</p>\n<p><strong>故事3，薄瓜瓜的故事：</strong><br />\n “I did not drive at all that evening, and certainly did not sit in a red sports car,” Bo Guagua said by telephone on Friday, in his first interview since his father was deposed and both parents were put under investigation. “I’m not sure where this story comes from.”</p>\n<p><strong>故事4，参加晚餐的人之一</strong>（one of the three person who had been at the dinner）：<br />\nMr. Huntsman had met the younger Mr. Bo and his father before in Chongqing and had been so impressed that he wanted the children to get together. Mr. Bo said he had arrived at the dinner in a black Audi sedan driven by a chauffeur, a common car among families of senior officials.</p>\n<p><strong>故事5，Ms. Livingston 的故事：</strong><br />\nMy dad’s version of the story has always been a reflection of what we told him. </p>\n<p>The woman who had organized the dinner picked up Ms. Livingston and her sister at the ambassador’s residence and drove them to Nobu, an upscale Japanese restaurant. There, they met Mr. Bo for the first time, along with several other strangers.</p>\n<p>The dinner lasted more than an hour. Then Mr. Bo, Mary Anne Huntsman and a European friend of Mr. Bo’s left for a bar. Ms. Huntsman stayed there for an hour or two before taking a taxi home.</p>\n<p>Ms. Huntsman had told her that she left Nobu with Mr. Bo and his European friend and got into a red sports car, which Mr. Bo drove to a bar “at a very fast speed.”</p>\n<p>“Mary Anne described it as a Ferrari, but she is not completely knowledgeable about cars and doesn’t want to mistake the actual car type.” </p>\n<p><strong>故事6，参加晚餐的人之二</strong>（Mr. Bo’s European friend）：<br />\nMr. Bo and his driver had picked him up for dinner in the black Audi, and then they had gone in that same car with Ms. Huntsman to the bar. He said, “In no way was there a red car.”</p>\n<p><strong>故事7，参加晚餐的人之三</strong>（The organizer, a member of the expatriate community in Beijing）：<br />\nThe organizer, a member of the expatriate community in Beijing who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, gave her account of the dinner in an interview, and it matched Ms. Livingston’s.</p>\n<p><strong>纽约时报有话说：</strong></p>\n<p>Though everyone agrees on how the daughters were picked up for dinner, there are competing accounts among Mr. Bo and the daughters of some details later that night.</p>\n<p>It is unclear why Mr. Huntsman passed on a different account or why his daughters did not seek earlier to correct it. Ms. Livingston declined to address those questions.</p>\n<p><strong>尼罗河有话说：</strong></p>\n<p>薄瓜瓜的法拉利故事源头是洪博培的两个女儿，大女儿Mary Anne Huntsman, 和另一个女儿 Abby Huntsman Livingston。薄瓜瓜那天约会的是Mary。Abby参加了晚餐但是没有去酒吧。薄瓜瓜开法拉利和一个欧洲朋友带Mary去酒吧，这件事后来Mary告诉了妹妹Abby。洪博培从Mary 或者Abby 那里听到这件事，把这件事告诉给了纽约时报的记者，还告诉给了美国大使馆的两个同事。</p>\n<p>堂堂一个美国大使说这些干嘛？没有人觉得奇怪吗？薄瓜瓜和一个欧洲朋友带着Mary开着法拉利去酒吧。Mary和他们两个男人在酒吧待了1到2个小时。最后Mary taking a taxi home！这才是为什么洪博培要到处讲这个故事的真正原因。</p>\n<p>洪大使的千金和两个绅士一起去酒吧最后自己打出租车的回家，这难道不是太离谱了吗？洪大使一气之下把这件事情到处说。法拉利故事终于演变成了罗生门。薄瓜瓜的“欧洲朋友”说他们一起乘“黑色奥迪”去酒吧。纽约时报记者应该问问薄瓜瓜的“欧洲朋友”，那天晚上他们是怎么离开酒吧的，还是一起乘“黑色奥迪”吗？</p>\n<p>那天晚上Mary为什么打出租回家？在哪家酒吧里究竟发生了什么？世界新闻网的消息就是一个很合理的解释。</p>\n<p>世界新闻网消息，最新一期「亚洲周刊」指出，薄瓜瓜与前美国驻北京大使洪博培的女儿约会时，因对洪博培千金「动手动脚」，让洪博培非常生气，差点引发两国外交风波。</p>\n<p>薄瓜瓜开着法拉利与前美国驻北京大使洪博培女儿约会的消息，最早由「华尔街日报」于去年十一月披露。「亚洲周刊」指出，那次约会，薄瓜瓜没有表现出留学英国的英伦绅士风范，而是动手动脚，涉嫌性骚扰洪博培千金，让洪博培非常生气，差点酿成外交风波，在北京权力圈也广为流传。</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.dwnews.com/?ak_action=api_record_view&amp;id=194191&amp;type=feed\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.dwnews.com/?ak_action=api_record_view&amp;id=194191&amp;type=feed\" /></p>\n<p>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</p>\n<p>Loading&#8230;</p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=738338\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> </p>\n<p>\n</form>\n","author":1002,"categories":[20534],"tags":[17230,19193,18937,10076,19252,9164,15466,11800]}
