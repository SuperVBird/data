Amid a growing clamour, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/29/china-developers-compensation-demolition\" title=\"government issued draft rules designed to curb\">government issued draft<br />\nrules designed to curb</a> the worst abuses.</span></p>\n<p><span>But the issue remains potent. Only last week, three people<br />\nin Fuzhou, eastern <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china\" title=\"More from guardian.co.uk on China\">China</a>, were rushed to hospital in<br />\nserious condition after setting fire to themselves in protest at what they said<br />\nwas inadequate compensation.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;This is our society. It is tiring. It is not easy to<br />\nlive. I don&#39;t know how many people are like the Ding family in real life. So<br />\nsad,&#8221; wrote one player.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another added: &#8220;The game is just for entertainment,<br />\nbut the reality is cruel.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>In the game, Mrs Ding [Nail], still in her curlers, hurls<br />\nslippers as the men approach, while Grandpa Ding prefers to fire his shotgun.<br />\nIt might sound improbable, but one real life farmer in Hubei province <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6573RH20100608\" title=\"fought off workers with a homemade cannon\">fought off workers with a<br />\nhomemade cannon</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http://english.17173.com/\" title=\"Popular online gaming site 17173\">Popular online gaming site 17173</a><br />\nsaid the nail-house game ranked third among last month&#8217;s top <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/games\" title=\"More from guardian.co.uk on Games\">games</a> and had been played more<br />\nthan 1.8m times since its launch two weeks ago. The real figure is likely to be<br />\nhigher since that is based on a tally of popular sites and the game has quickly<br />\nbeen replicated across the web.</span></p>\n<p><span>Professor Hu Yong, of Peking University&#8217;s School of Journalism<br />\nand Communications, said forced demolitions had long been a hot topic, with<br />\ndramatic and horrifying stories circulating in the media or online.</span></p>\n<p><span>He added: &#8220;Forced demolition is about the conflict<br />\nbetween governmental power and the individual&#39;s ownership of property. Although<br />\nChina has a property ownership law, it has never been implemented well. People<br />\ncare a lot when governmental power violates an individual&#39;s ownership because<br />\nit simply can happen to anyone.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;As social conflicts increase, governmental power is<br />\ngetting stronger and stronger as well and a lot of people are resentful about<br />\nit. That&#39;s why such a little game can resonate among so many people.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>Players pointed out that it appeared to be impossible to<br />\nwin the game, because so many thugs swarm the house in the final level – a<br />\nrealistic touch, they thought.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;I have already got 70,000 [points] in the game but my<br />\nhouse was still demolished.
