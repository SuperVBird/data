While Weibo users usually must have<br />\na large number of followers to get responses to posts—which are broadcast<br />\npublicly—on WeChat, users can directly chat with groups of friends, or comment<br />\non photographs.</span></p>\n<p><span>Despite investor<br />\nhopes, which have pushed Sina&apos;s share price up 40% since April, others question<br />\nhow many people will continue to use Weibo if the crackdown on rumors<br />\ncontinues. Though analysts say those on Weibo use the service with widely<br />\nvarying interests and motives, one of Weibo&apos;s strongest appeals has been the<br />\nopenness with which it enabled its users to discuss sensitive issues.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Chinese<br />\ngovernment puts the burden on Sina to choose how it censors content on the<br />\nplatform and Sina has in turn played a delicate balancing act, shutting down<br />\ndiscussions that touch a political nerve or could lead to protests, while at<br />\nthe same time leaving enough of interest to keep users coming back.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Users will<br />\nlower their activity on [Weibo], but they will choose other alternatives,&#8221;<br />\nsaid Isaac Mao, principal researcher at research group Sharism Lab and one<br />\nof China&apos;s first bloggers. &#8220;People on Internet forums are all discussing<br />\nswitching to other services including WeChat, private social networks, [and]<br />\noverseas services that aren&apos;t blocked, like Instagram.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>WeChat&apos;s more<br />\nintimate and private social-networking functions have led to competition with<br />\nWeibo for users&apos; time, said Sina&apos;s chief executive, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://topics.wsj.com/person/C/Charles--Chao/6759\"><span>Charles Chao</span></a>, during an earnings call last<br />\nyear.</span></p>\n<p><span>Last year, Mr. Chao<br />\nsaid time spent on Weibo had diminished because of apps like WeChat, which at<br />\nthe end of June had 236 million monthly active users, according to Tencent.<br />\nWeibo had 54 million daily active users at the end of June, according to Sina.<br />\nAlthough last quarter Sina said time spent on its service increased, many users<br />\nsay the new crackdown has increased their use of WeChat.</span></p>\n<p><span>Qiao Mu, director of<br />\nthe Center for International Communication Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies<br />\nUniversity, said that, for those looking to influence public debate in China,<br />\nWeChat could still be useful despite its more fragmented environment.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Its influence<br />\nis not as big as Weibo, but it can be very effective because you&apos;re talking to<br />\npeople who you know and who will pay attention to what you say. It&apos;s not as<br />\neasy to control or monitor because there are so many small networks, and you<br />\ncan constantly change your account,&#8221; he said.</span></p>\n<p><span>That doesn&apos;t mean<br />\nWeChat is immune from government interference, however.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Some people<br />\nmight think WeChat is safer because it&apos;s not public, but if the government<br />\nreally wants to control the discourse, they have lots of means at their<br />\ndisposal,&#8221; said Hu Yong, an Internet scholar at Beijing University.</span></p>\n<p><span>In an essay published<br />\nTuesday in the Communist Party&apos;s flagship newspaper People&apos;s Daily, Lu Wei, one<br />\nof China&apos;s top officials in charge of Internet monitoring and censorship,<br />\nindicated that the government doesn&apos;t intend to let up soon.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;If we do not<br />\neffectively occupy newly emerged public opinion battlefields, other people will<br />\noccupy them, creating challenges to our power of initiative and discourse as we<br />\ncarry out public-opinion work,&#8221; he wrote.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Write<br />\nto </span></strong><span>Paul Mozur at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sohu.com\"><span>paul.mozur@dowjones.com</span></a> and<span> </span><span><span>Josh</span></span><span> </span>Chin<br />\nat <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sohu.com\"><span><span>josh</span></span><span>.chin@wsj.com</span></a></span></p>\n<p><i><span>A version<br />\nof this article appeared September 19, 2013, on page A6 in the U.S. edition of<br />\nThe Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Mobile-Messaging Provider Gains a<br />\nVoice Amid Beijing&apos;s Censorship Efforts.<span></span></span></i></p>\n<div>\n<p align=\"left\"><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=2ea93c5b7b\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/msuvD\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
