I was ready to put on one of my five face masks, but when I took my first breath of American air. I put my mask away.</p>\n<p>The air was so sweet and fresh, and oddly luxurious.</p>\n<p>I was surprised by this. I grew up in a city in China, where I had to wear a face mask every time I went outside, otherwise, I might get sick.</p>\n<p>However, the moment I inhaled and exhaled outside the airport.</p>\n<p>I felt free.</p>\n<p>No more fog on my glasses, no more difficult breathing, no more suppression.</p>\n<p>Every breath was a delight. As I stand here today, I cannot help, but recall that feeling of freedom.</p>\n<p>At the University of Maryland, I assume feel another kind of fresh air for which I will be forever grateful — the fresh air of free speech.</p>\n<p>Before I came to United States, I learned in history class about the Declaration of Independence, but these words had no meaning to me— Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness.</p>\n<p>I was merely memorizing the words to get good grades.</p>\n<p>These words sounded so strange, so abstract and so foreign to me, until I came to University of Maryland.</p>\n<p>I have leaned the right to freely express oneself is sacred in American.</p>\n<p>Each day in Maryland, I was encouraged to express my opinions on controversial issues.</p>\n<p>I could challenge a statement made by my instructor. I could even rate my professors online.</p>\n<p>But nothing prepared me for the culture shock I experienced when I watched a university production of the play— Twilight: Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Twilight is a play by Anna Deavere Smith about the 1992 Los Angeles Riots</p>\n<p>The riots followed acquittal of four Los Angeles police officers in the videotaped arrest and beating of Rodney King.</p>\n<p>For six days, the city was in chaos as citizens took to the streets.</p>\n<p>In Twilight, the student actors were openly talking about racism, sexism and politics.</p>\n<p>I was shocked, I never saw such topic could be discussed openly.</p>\n<p>The play was my first taste of political storytelling, one that makes the audience think critically.</p>\n<p>I have always had a burning desire to tell these kinds of stories, but I was convinced that only authorities on the narrative, only authorities could define the truth.</p>\n<p>However, the opportunity to immerse myself in the diverse community at the University of Maryland exposed me to various, many different perspectives on truth.</p>\n<p>I soon realized that here I have the opportunity to speak freely.</p>\n<p>My voice matters.</p>\n<p>Your voice matters.</p>\n<p>Our voices matter.</p>\n<p>Civil engagement is not a task just for politicians. I have witnessed this when I saw my fellow students marching in Washington DC, voting in the presidential election and raising money for support various causes.</p>\n<p>I have seen that everyone has a right to participate and advocate for change.</p>\n<p>I used to believe that one individual participation could not make a difference, but here we are, United Terps.</p>\n<p>Together, we can push our society to be more just open and peaceful.</p>\n<p>Class of 2017, we are graduating from a university that embraces a liberal arts education that nurtures us to think critically, and also to care and feel for humanity.</p>\n<p>We are equipped with the knowledge of various disciplines and we are ready to face to the challenges of our society.</p>\n<p>Some of us may go to graduate school, some us may step into professions and some of us may begin a journey of exploration.</p>\n<p>But no matter what we do, remember, democracy and free speech should not be taken for granted.</p>\n<p>Democracy and freedom are the fresh air that is worth fighting for.</p>\n<p>Freedom is oxygen. Freedom is passion. Freedom is love.</p>\n<p>And as a French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre once said: freedom is a choice, our future is dependent on the choices we make today and tomorrow.</p>\n<p>We are all playwrights of the next chapters of our lives. Together, we right the human history.</p>\n<p>My friends, enjoy the fresh air and never let it go.</p>\n<p>Thank you.​​​​</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wuP0EKJdkz4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","author":1015,"categories":[18271,18270,18269,20505],"tags":[9754,24447,10216,31997,14238,32801,10435,10510,15989,32806]}
