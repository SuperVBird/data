They<br />\nincluded the May 2008 Sichuan earthquake, in which thousands of children were<br />\ncrushed by poorly built schools, and tainted milk that sickened almost 300,000<br />\nbabies later the same year.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>What’s different this time is the public scrutiny on<br />\nweibo meant the government “lost control of the story line,” says Patrick<br />\nChovanec, a professor at Tsinghua University’s School of Economics and<br />\nManagement in Beijing.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“The crash isn’t the problem as much as the government’s<br />\nresponse, which is seen to be patronizing and not credible,” he says. “People<br />\njust weren’t buying it.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>Middle Classes</span></b></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The outrage over the crash has a very middle class tone<br />\nto it, says Wedeman of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. China has pulled<br />\nmore than 500 million people &#8212; almost a quarter of the population &#8212; out of<br />\npoverty since China began economic reforms in 1978, according to a United<br />\nNations</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.un.org.cn/public/resource/4c77763d55297ee35badca55060a2c09.pdf\" title=\"Open Web Site\"><span>estimate</span></a>.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“They’re angry about the quality of the train and the<br />\ncover-up,” Wedeman says. “China’s professionals, the beneficiaries of reform,<br />\nwho should be rock solid in their support for the regime, are beginning to question<br />\nthe ability of the government to furnish a better life.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>In all, China’s high-speed rail suffered 168 glitches in<br />\nJuly, the 21st Century Business Herald reported Sept. 5, citing a separate<br />\nRailways Ministry internal report.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Some of those failures may be related to corruption, says<br />\nSiva Yam, president of the U.S.-China Chamber of Commerce in</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/chicago/\"><span>Chicago</span></a>. Railways<br />\nMinister</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/liu-zhijun/\"><span>Liu Zhijun</span></a>, who<br />\nchampioned the high- speed network, was fired early this year over corruption.<br />\nThe ministry has a virtual monopoly, as many employees as the U.S. government<br />\nand its own court system.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>Great Leap Mentality</span></b></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“Liu had this great-leap mentality and he wanted to roll<br />\nout this system much faster than they should have,” says Damien Ma, China<br />\nanalyst at Washington-based Eurasia Group. “They did a lot of scrimping.” Liu<br />\ncouldn’t be reached for comment.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Wang says she hopes the government report on the accident<br />\nwill fix blame and prevent future accidents.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“When we have the truth, my husband’s soul can rest and<br />\nthe whole family can have a little comfort,” Wang says from her home in<br />\nLianjiang in Fuzhou, 368 miles (592 kilometers) south of<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/shanghai/\"><span>Shanghai</span></a>. “Give us some guarantee that the<br />\nlives of ordinary Chinese are safe.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The widow and her late husband exemplify China’s economic<br />\ntransformation. Hailing from Xuzhou in northern China, Wang moved to the<br />\nsouthwestern coastal town of Xiamen, across the strait from</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/taiwan/\"><span>Taiwan</span></a>, to work on<br />\ncruise ships. Zheng was her colleague.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>They married in 2005 and moved to Zheng’s hometown of<br />\nLianjiang and he started a foot-massage business, eventually expanding into<br />\nrestaurants and Internet cafes. Over those six years, per-person annual income<br />\nfor China’s city dwellers almost doubled to more than 19,000 yuan.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>Good Life</span></b></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“He promised me a good life,” Wang says. The couple<br />\nvacationed at beach resorts on Hainan Island, off China’s southern coast, and<br />\nvisited Beijing to see Tiananmen Square. Two years ago, Zheng bought a black<br />\nBuick luxury sedan. When a daughter arrived, they nicknamed her Tangtang, or<br />\nSweetie, and Wang became a stay-at-home mom.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“I didn’t have to worry about money,” she says. Wang<br />\nshows the last photo she has of her husband, taken with her iPhone in the<br />\nPeople’s Square in Lianjiang on July 19. In it, Zheng is wearing jeans, black<br />\nT-shirt and flip-flops, bending next to Tangtang, whose hair is swept off her<br />\nface with barrettes. He’s pointing to Wang.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>Car Crushed</span></b></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Zheng left that night, Wang says. Instead of driving, as<br />\nhe usually did, he opted to take the bullet train.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Four days later, Zheng called his wife, who was attending<br />\na wedding with Tangtang, to say he was heading home. His seat was near the back<br />\nof the last-but-one car, the ticket found on his body showed.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>At about 8:40 p.m., Wang remembers, Tangtang started<br />\nscreaming and crying. They had to leave the wedding early.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>What she didn’t know was that 10 minutes earlier, another<br />\ntrain, traveling more than 100 kilometers per hour,</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjg4MTQxMTky.html\" title=\"Open Web Site\"><span>slammed into</span></a></span><span> </span><span>Zheng’s train. The impact knocked three rail cars off a<br />\nviaduct and another hanging over the side.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>On her way home from the wedding, Wang got a call from<br />\nthe family of a friend who was traveling with Zheng informing her of the<br />\ncollision. The friend had tried to find Zheng in the chaos but couldn’t.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Wang says she tried Zheng’s phone. No answer. He probably<br />\nlost his phone in the accident, she remembers thinking.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>‘The Sky Collapsed’</span></b></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Early on July 25, Wang was driven by relatives to<br />\nWenzhou. When they reached the highway exit, she received a call telling her to<br />\ngo to the morgue not a hospital, as she had believed.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“It felt like the sky collapsed on me,” Wang says.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The dead included two schoolgirls, an Italian tourist and<br />\na pregnant woman who was killed with four family members, according to accounts<br />\nin the Chinese press.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>On July 29, Chinese media received an order from national<br />\nauthorities to “calm down” coverage. They were told to focus on positive news<br />\nor information from the authorities, according to a copy seen by Bloomberg<br />\nNews.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The Economic Observer, a Beijing-based national business<br />\nweekly, was among publications that defied the gag order, printing an open<br />\nletter to the rescued orphan Xiang on its August 1 front page starting “Dear<br />\nYiyi,” which said:</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“This country has created one economic miracle after<br />\nanother. They claim that’s for people’s benefit, but wouldn’t slow down to<br />\nlisten to the living beings.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>Critical Mass</span></b></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Journalists posted images online of newspaper pages that<br />\nwere spiked because of the government directive. They were later deleted. The<br />\nCommunist Party’s publicity department, which oversees China’s media, didn’t<br />\nanswer faxed questions about the directive.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Whether this outpouring of anger will result in greater<br />\ntransparency from the government or a tighter crackdown is an open question,<br />\nsays Elizabeth C. Economy, director for Asia Studies at the</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/council-on-foreign-relations/\"><span>Council on Foreign Relations</span></a></span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/new-york/\"><span>New York</span></a>.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“Does all the chatter build to critical mass?” Economy<br />\nsays. “I’m a firm believer that the day will come.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>For all her discontent, Wang Hui accepted the<br />\ncompensation offer after she was repeatedly visited by unidentified officials.<br />\nOn Aug. 2, one group came to her hotel in Wenzhou to offer condolences and<br />\nmuttered audibly about potential problems with her husband’s body because it<br />\nwasn’t refrigerated, she says.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>No Choice</span></b></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“I felt that I had done things that hurt my husband,” she<br />\nsays, tears rolling down her cheeks. “As if I were the one discussing<br />\ncompensation using his body.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>There was no choice but to sign, she says. Huang Leping,<br />\na Beijing attorney Wang had consulted, said she had little chance of winning if<br />\nshe sued the ministry.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Victims in such cases are often helpless because China’s<br />\ncourts may not hear the cases and lawyers are warned away from representing<br />\nthem, says Jerome Cohen, a professor of law at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/new-york-university/\"><span>New York University</span></a></span><span> </span><span>who<br />\nspecializes in China legal issues.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Those who continue to protest for greater justice also<br />\nrisk recriminations. Zhao Lianhai, whose son was poisoned by milk contaminated<br />\nwith melamine, was jailed after he tried to organize other parents to campaign.<br />\nHe’s since been freed.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Wang says she just wanted to ensure her husband was cremated<br />\nso she could take his ashes back home.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>When she collected his body, there was one thing missing:<br />\nZheng’s silver Audemars Piguet wristwatch. He’d planned to give it to Tangtang<br />\nwhen she got older. Only a mark remained on the wrist where it was, Wang says.<br />\nThe police told her it must have been lost in the crash, she says. She thinks<br />\nit was stolen.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“When my daughter grows up, what can I say to her?” Wang<br />\nsays. “Her dad is gone. Just like that. Leaving her nothing but a watch, which<br />\nnobody knows who took.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Since the accident, Tangtang has become clingy and likes<br />\nto open her parents’ wedding album, Wang says. When she sees her daddy’s<br />\npicture, she kisses it.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Wang kept her husband’s last train ticket.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“It feels as if he’s still on a business trip,” she says.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>On Aug. 22, a day before the one-month anniversary of<br />\nZheng’s death, the widow commemorated his 35th birthday.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>She bought him some new clothes.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>&#8211;Wenxin Fan, Bob Ivry.
