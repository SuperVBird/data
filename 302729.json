Officials have been able to pull<br />\ndown controversial posts and block search terms on sensitive topics, but posts<br />\nspread fast before being removed.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>&#8220;Weibo<br />\nhas changed the opinions of many people. Back then, many people supported the<br />\ngovernment in what they saw as an attack from the West,&#8221; Xiong said.<br />\n&#8220;Many have now realised that they had been wrong.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The lines<br />\nhave been redrawn between left and right, or what others call conservatives<br />\nversus liberals or patriots versus the West, he added.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>&#8220;The<br />\nvalues Li talks about are not Western, but universal,&#8221; said Hu Yong, a<br />\nBeijing-based liberal media scholar. &#8220;In this sense, it&apos;s<br />\nenlightening.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The<br />\nappeal of new social critics like Li &#8211; handsome, funny and fierce &#8211; is their<br />\nstark contrast to an older generation of academic dissidents and traditional<br />\nleftists.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Those on<br />\nthe left recognise that they are losing their appeal. Some commentators on<br />\nWeibo &#8220;have millions or even tens of millions of followers&#8221;, Ren<br />\nXianliang , a vice-chairman of the All-China Journalists Association, said in<br />\nan article last week in the party journal Red Flag.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>For<br />\nXiong, the leftists are a small but vocal minority.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>&#8220;The<br />\nleftist wumao [government-paid online commentators] are<br />\nlooking for a fight with liberals,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&apos;s why that group<br />\nseems to be bigger than it actually is.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The<br />\nmoment the debate changed, said Xiong, was a brawl at Beijing&apos;s Chaoyang Park<br />\nlast July. Leftist microblogger Wu Danhong, who posts on Weibo under the alias<br />\nWu Fatian, confronted a group of liberals who were in the company of the<br />\nSichuan Television journalist Zhou Yan and the prominent artist Ai Weiwei .</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The<br />\naltercation, though little more than pushing and shoving, became more<br />\nsignificant online, where insults continue to be traded in a way they would be<br />\nhardly tolerated on the streets. It culminated in an assault on Li at a book<br />\nlaunch in January.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Li&apos;s<br />\nbook, The Whole World Knows<i>, </i>became an instant bestseller to<br />\nthe chagrin of leftists &#8220;who see social criticism as unpatriotic&#8221;,<br />\nsaid Hu Yong, an associate professor at Peking University&apos;s school of<br />\njournalism.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The<br />\nrenewed debate on values and the direction of the country is taking is a good<br />\nthing, said Hu, adding that &#8220;China hasn&apos;t had such a debate for<br />\ndecades&#8221;.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>&#8220;Both<br />\nright and left want to change the course society is taking,&#8221; he said.<br />\n&#8220;The most frightening thing is neither the left or right, but vested<br />\ninterests seeking to maintain the status quo.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><i><span>This article first appeared in the South China Morning<br />\nPost print edition on Apr 17, 2013 as Old battle lines recast between left and<br />\nright</span></i></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=b4fd4ae247\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/mstlf\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
