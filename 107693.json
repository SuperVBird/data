Even with this reform, China is thought to execute more<br />\nprisoners than the rest of the world put together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Foreign government and civil rights<br />\norganisations have repeatedly called on China to move towards<br />\nabolition, particularly after miscarriages of justice. Concerns<br />\nalso grew after the execution of Akmal Sheikh, the convicted<br />\nBritish heroin smuggler who was given a lethal injection last<br />\nDecember. He was the first European in 50 years to get the death<br />\npenalty in China despite his family&#8217;s claims that he was suffering<br />\nfrom mental illness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>That case would probably not have been<br />\naffected by the revision submitted to the standing committee of the<br />\nNational People&#8217;s Congress this month, which mainly focused on<br />\nwhite collar crime.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>According to the Xinhua news agency, it<br />\nproposes cutting the death penalty for 13 &#8220;economy-related,<br />\nnon-violent offences&#8221; and for people aged 75 and over. It also<br />\ncriminalises the trade in human organs, many of which come from<br />\nvictims of the death penalty.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Overseas human rights groups say it is<br />\ndifficult to assess whether the revision marks a change of style or<br />\nsubstance because the number of death penalties remains a state<br />\nsecret.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>&#8220;We welcome any genuine attempt to<br />\nreduce the death penalty in China, but it is unclear whether this<br />\nis legislative housekeeping that will have little effect on the<br />\noverall number of executions,&#8221; said Catherine Baber, Amnesty<br />\nInternational&#8217;s deputy programme director for Asia. &#8220;China could<br />\ncertainly make more meaningful reductions. We encourage them to<br />\nmake more effort to catch up with the global trend, which is to<br />\nabolish the death penalty.&#8221;</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are also fears that an increase<br />\nin the maximum life sentence from 20 to 25 years – another proposed<br />\nrevision to the criminal code – could result in more miscarriages<br />\nof justice if judges use this option when there is insufficient<br />\nevidence for the death penalty.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Local lawyers said, however, that the<br />\ndraft was an important step forward. &#8220;This is a significant change<br />\nthat shows the progress of the Chinese legal system and public<br />\nawareness about the law,&#8221; said Han Jiayi, a senior member of the<br />\nAll-China Lawyers&#8217; Association. &#8220;In my own practice I have observed<br />\na steady decrease in the number of death penalty cases. Even if<br />\nthese 13 crimes were not removed from the list, the reality is that<br />\nthey are rarely punished with the maximum penalty nowadays.&#8221;</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He Weifang, a law professor at Peking<br />\nUniversity, said international opinion and appeals from academics<br />\nin China had encouraged the authorities to scale back the list of<br />\ncrimes. &#8220;But an even more important fact is that the death penalty<br />\nhas not proved very effective in reducing economic crime.&#8221;</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Not all the sentencing is obsolete,<br />\nhowever. Last year a man was given the death penalty for smuggling<br />\n82 saker falcons and other endangered species. This would no long<br />\nwarrant execution if the draft revision is approved by the National<br />\nPeople&#8217;s Congress.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>• Additional reporting by Cui Zheng</p>\n<h2>Crimes<br />\nthat could escape the death penalty</h2>\n<p>If the revision to the criminal code is<br />\naccepted, the following offences will no longer be punishable by<br />\ndeath in China:</p>\n<p>Smuggling antiquities</p>\n<p>Smuggling precious metals</p>\n<p>Smuggling rare animals and rare animal<br />\nproducts</p>\n<p>Smuggling ordinary goods and<br />\nmaterials</p>\n<p>Receipt fraud</p>\n<p>Financial document fraud</p>\n<p>Credit note fraud</p>\n<p>Writing false VAT receipts for tax<br />\nreimbursement</p>\n<p>Selling forged VAT</p>\n<p>Theft</p>\n<p>Teaching criminal methods</p>\n<p>Theft of ancient cultural relics</p>\n<p>Theft of fossils</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/23/china-death-penalty-crime-executions\"><br />\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/23/china-death-penalty-crime-executions</a></p>\n</div>\n","author":176,"categories":[9203],"tags":[13688]}
