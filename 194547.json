A ceasefire saw some 19,000 rebel fighters moved into camps across the country, but brought little stability. As long as no one could decide what to do with the leftist ex-fighters, parties could not agree on a new constitution. Without one, politics has been a mess. Governments have formed and disintegrated faster than a snowflake in a Himalayan gale.</p></blockquote>\n<p>五年前，尼泊尔臭名昭著的毛主义暴动在持续了10年并夺去18000个生命后结束。在与政府签订停火协议之后，全国范围内19000多名武装叛乱分子返回军营之中，但其动荡局面并无多大改观。若仍无举措来处置这些前左翼武装分子，各政党就无法在新宪法上取得一致。也正因为宪法的缺失，其政坛一直混乱不堪。政府一再成形，一再瓦解，如狂风中的雪花般易逝。</p>\n<blockquote><p>So the relief was palpable in Kathmandu on November 1st, when the leaders of four main political parties held hands and announced a deal for the Maoist ex-fighters. Nearly two-thirds will don civvies, their pockets stuffed with a handout of up to $11,500 each (more than nine times an average Nepali’s annual income). The remaining 6,500 or so ex-fighters will be shunted into a new army unit to guard forests, provide disaster relief and do other useful things.</p></blockquote>\n<p>11月1日，在四个政党的主要领导人在加德满都握手言和并宣布了一项针对毛主义前武装分子的决议。三分之二的前武装分子将重新融入社会，当局将向每个人分发多达11500美元（这是尼泊尔国民年均收入的9倍之多），而剩下的6500多人将被整合到一个新的陆军部队，用于森林守卫，灾害救援和其他用途。</p>\n<blockquote><p>Getting the army to accept its former Maoist enemies was hard. Tougher still was wrangling among the Maoists themselves, who now dominate the government. Pragmatists like the current prime minister, Baburam Bhattarai, managed to overrule party ideologues who do not want full integration and still openly oppose the deal. Mr Bhattarai has been shrewd in other ways too, for instance, in warming up relations with India that had cooled as Nepal grew closer to China.</p></blockquote>\n<p>让如今的军队去接纳曾经与之为敌的毛主义武装分子是一个难题，而更棘手的是如今执政党——尼联合共产党(毛主义)内部的矛盾。实用主义者，包括现任的总理巴布拉姆·巴特拉伊在内，成功否决了那些不支持全面统一且仍公开反对该决议的空想家们。 在其他方面，巴特拉伊也是明智的，如在尼泊尔与中国拉近距离之际“回暖”与印度之间的关系。 </p>\n<blockquote><p>With luck, more problems can now be resolved. “We’ve been waiting for this moment for five years”, enthuses Anagha Neelakantan of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank. Drafting the constitution may take another six months. That looks tricky but doable. An unusual, informal deal has reportedly been struck allowing the parties, each of which is too small to rule alone, to take turns in government. Mr Bhattarai is likely to stay in office until the constitution is done, probably next year. Then the opposition Nepali Congress Party expects to move into government to oversee elections. None of this will be easy. But at least parties are finding a framework for peaceful compromise, and that must count as progress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>顺利的话，其他问题如今可一并解决。来自国际危机组织智囊团的阿纳嘎尼拉康坦慷慨激扬地说道：“我们为这一刻等了五年。”宪法的起草需要六个月的时间，棘手但可行。另外据报道，由于各政党难以单独执政，各方已签订一个特殊而不正式的协议，规定各党将轮流执政。巴特拉伊将在新宪法完成之前继续任职总理，而新宪法极有可能明年才能完成。反对党尼泊尔大会党则希望能进驻政府监督选举。这些都绝非易事，但至少各党派都在为和平协议寻求框架，不得不说这已是进展。 </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www1.feedsky.com/t1/573825759/yeeyan/feedsky/s.gif?r=http://article.yeeyan.org/view/255317/229949\" border=\"0\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=738338\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"738338\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":993,"categories":[20534],"tags":[]}
