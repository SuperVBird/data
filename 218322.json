It said Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd., which has helped produce Ai&#8217;s internationally renowned art and designs, will only be given &#8220;a written hearing&#8221; and not a public trial.</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>&#8220;I think this is inconceivable,&#8221; Ai said. &#8220;Our lawyer said: &#8216;Which country in the world doesn&#8217;t dare to face their own taxpayers?'&#8221;</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>&#8220;We can&#8217;t understand the problem. I can only think that anything that cannot be made public is due to embarrassment at making it public,&#8221; Ai said.</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>&#8220;As the people who&#8217;ve been charged, we aren&#8217;t afraid of making it public. But as a country, how can you be afraid of being transparent?&#8221;</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>Beijing tax authorities were not immediately available for comment.</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>Ai paid a bond of 8.45 million yuan last November &#8211; all contributions from tens of thousands of supporters &#8211; that allowed him access to an administrative review of the tax evasion charges. He told Reuters then that he was pessimistic about successfully contesting the charges.</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>The company&#8217;s lawyer, Pu Zhiqiang, said written decisions are legal, but are &#8220;a bad sign&#8221; because they usually uphold the original decision of the case.</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>Pu said authorities have not shown him any original documents with evidence of the alleged tax evasion and held a closed hearing last July. Pu said it was illegal for them to do so. Ai was barred from attending, but his wife, Lu Qing, was present.</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>&#8220;All these circumstances have led me to firmly believe that the handling of Ai Weiwei&#8217;s company&#8217;s (case) is a form of persecution, and that the tax authorities are helping the public security organs do their work under orders,&#8221; Pu said.</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>Ai was detained without any charge in April and held mainly in solitary confinement until his conditional release in June.</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>But the bearded artist has ignored efforts to silence him and has instead become a rallying point for China&#8217;s dissidents and activists under pressure since a government crackdown last year brought a wave of detentions and arrests.</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>Ai had collected more than 9 million yuan, that he says he will return, from about 30,000 donors, for the tax penalty.</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>The tax authorities have until the end of April to give Ai a decision on the administrative review of the case, Ai said.</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>When Ai was released on bail last June, the government said he remained under investigation on suspicion of economic crimes.</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>Ai told Reuters previously that he had not received a formal notice to explain &#8220;suspected economic crimes&#8221;.</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<div>(Reporting by Sui-Lee Wee; Editing by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&#038;n=sugita.katyal&#038;\">Sugita Katyal</a>)</div>\n<div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4214948278400391962-864086670299649876?l=loveaiww.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>\n</p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=735659\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"735659\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"450\" height=\"309\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n","author":1004,"categories":[20534],"tags":[16910,9625]}
