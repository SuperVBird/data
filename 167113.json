So far we have no documents from our own accountant, and the hearing is not open to the public, therefore I think the hearing is already biased against us.<br />路青说：我认为听证会本身已经是对我们不公正。目前为止，我们没有从我们的会计那里得到税务文档，听证会对公众不公开。</p>\n<p>SABAPATHY: At the heart of the case is the Chinese authority&#8217;s claims that the company failed to pay some 770 thousand dollars in taxes over the last decade and added a fine of 1 point 1 million dollars to it.</p>\n<p>Ai Wei Wei&#8217;s family denies any tax evasion while activists say the accusations are a false premise to detain the artist.</p>\n<p>Fu Hua Ling, professor of Law at the University of Hong Kong says China has a problem collecting taxes.<br />傅華伶教授（香港大學法律學院教授）说中国收税上一直有问题。</p>\n<p>FU: China has been run as a central planned economy, tax was not an issue, paying tax is something new for the citizens so it has not been easy for the government to collect taxes. The problem for China is really the cash economy its very difficult to track to trace so enforcement is extremely difficult.<br />傅说：中国过去一直是计划经济，所以税不是一个问题，而纳税对于公民来说是新的东西，所以对于政府来说收税并不是一个简单的任务。中国的问题是现金经济，很难跟踪，所以强制收税是很难的。</p>\n<p>SABAPATHY: Ai Wei Wei is just one of many nouveau riche Chinese but a constant political thorn in the government&#8217;s side.</p>\n<p>An outspoken critic of China&#8217;s leaders, an active participant in controversial social campaigns, Ai Wei Wei also called on the Chinese people to boycott the Olympics despite his input in the design and building of the birdnest stadium.</p>\n<p>AI: I realised this project is not going to be used to encourage freedom and democracy but rather a strong political party&#8217;s propaganda. So I feel very disappointed about this kind of opening performance which not allow the migrants to stay in Beijing, to limit all the citizens&#8217; normal activities just to show to the guests. I call this a fake smile which is against my ideology.</p>\n<p>SABAPATHY: Professor Fu says the targetting of Mr Ai on tax evasion is without doubt a political move.</p>\n<p>FU: I guess the position of the government is we may have done something that is unlawful you may have done something that is unlawful. If you challenge us we will challenge you. That has been consistent so when people criticise the government immediately the government will search their records and if you are a multi millionaire its not difficult to find some fault in your history.<br />傅说：我猜政府的姿态是：我们也许做了一些非法的事情，而你也同样做了。如果你挑战我们，我们就会挑战你。所以当人们批评政府的时候，政府会立刻搜集他们的记录；如果你是百万富翁，在你的历史记录上找点问题是非常容易的。</p>\n<p>SABAPATHY: Initial plans to charge Ai Wei Wei on criminal charges have been dropped and he now faces only charges of tax evasion. </p>\n<p>Professor Fu says this makes the case less sensitive and easier for the government to close.</p>\n<p>Now the offer of a guest professorial post at the Berlin University of the Arts for Ai Wei Wei provides another avenue for Beijing to rid itself of an irritant. Professor Fu.</p>\n<p>FU: I doubt the government would have a strong interest to keep him in China. That has been the tradition, the best way to end the political career of someone is to send them elsewhere.</p>\n<p>SABAPATHY: Ai Wei Wei has welcomed the offer but it&#8217;s not clear when exactly he can leave the country. He is still under investigation and is legally bound to remain in the country till June next year. And its still to be seen if his company will fight the tax evasion charges or just pay it up and clear the way for his early exit.</p>\n<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4214948278400391962-6332847034351650127?l=loveaiww.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/loveAiWeiwei/~4/umYx1peCSxs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":533,"categories":[1],"tags":[10825,9484]}
