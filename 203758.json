It centers around the Chinese word minsheng,<br />\nor “the people’s welfare,” which is a term that was part of [Chinese<br />\nrevolutionary leader] <b>SunYat-sen</b>’s Three People’s Principles<br />\n[nationalism, democracy and people’s welfare]. It’s a word the current Chinese<br />\ngovernment has been using lately to try to legitimize itself and to show that<br />\nit is doing its job of taking care of the basic social services — healthcare,<br />\neducating, housing etc. — that are its job.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The<br />\nreason I mention this word is because I’ve been noticing a trend on the Chinese<br />\ninternet that I call the transition from minzuzhuyi, nationalism,<br />\nto minsheng<i>.</i> I think the nationalist thing is in a downturn.<br />\nIt peaked during the Olympic Games in 2008. That was the year we also had the<br />\nriots in Tibet. But after the Olympics, people just didn’t find this<br />\nnationalist logic as appealing as before. The government still plays its<br />\nnationalist cards — the Shenzhou space program, the launch of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14470882\"><span>country’s first aircraft carrier</span></a>. They’re<br />\nstill doing these types of things to rouse people’s nationalist feeling, but I<br />\ndon’t think they’ve been that effective. [Conversations in Chinese cyberspace]<br />\nrevolve around minsheng issues. The <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43865656/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/die-china-high-speed-train-crash/#.Tu-n02C-hPY\"><span>high speed train crash</span></a> in July, was a<br />\nhuge event in Chinese cyberspace. People are deeply concerned about<br />\nenvironmental issues, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/world/asia/school-bus-crash-in-china-kills-15-children.html\"><span>school bus safety</span></a>, etc.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>I<br />\nwould say this is a general trend. A lot of Western observers are concerned<br />\nabout Chinese nationalism and particularly, about its use in cyberspace, but I<br />\nthink these concerns overestimate the role of nationalism.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span> </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>So<br />\nyou think the internet has the potential to make the Chinese government more<br />\nresponsive to popular concerns and demands?</span></b><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>It’s<br />\nnot just because I study it, but to a great extent, the only useful outlet for<br />\nthe expression of popular concerns in China is the internet. In China we<br />\nusually don’t have other outlets like elections, so people can’t hold officials<br />\naccountable, especially not township or above officials. We don’t have an<br />\nindependent judicial system and the traditional media are heavily controlled by<br />\nthe propaganda departments, so that leaves the Internet as, it could be said,<br />\nthe only venue for people to voice their opinions and concerns.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>I<br />\ndon’t think many Chinese officials go online, but they do have a mechanism for<br />\nthe aggregation of public opinion by certain personnel. These people are online<br />\ntrying to gather what people are saying and they turn it into a regular reports<br />\nthat are very popular among Chinese government officials.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>I<br />\nthink it’s strongly reflected in these reports that the issues in Chinese<br />\ncyberspace are always these bread and butter issues, and, a lot of “mass<br />\nincidents” are related to those issues — land grabbing, demolition, even the<br />\ntaxation of small enterprises.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span> </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>And<br />\nthese events are reported on people’s microblogs?</span></b><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The<br />\nmessage usually appears on microblogs first. People will start to<br />\npost photographs, what people are saying and sometimes video from the local<br />\npeople who happen to be traveling there. Those kinds of incidents — more than<br />\n50 percent — will be reported first on microblogs.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span> </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span><b><br /></b></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"450\" height=\"309\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n","author":1000,"categories":[9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
