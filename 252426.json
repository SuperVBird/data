The dispute came to a head after the Japanese government nationalized control of three of the largest islands earlier this month, purchasing them from a private Japanese family for more than US$25 million. The island group is called Senkaku Islands by the Japanese, Diaoyu Islands by the Chinese, Tiaoyutai Islands by Taiwanese, or the Pinnacle Islands by English speakers. Beyond national pride, potentially large gas reserves and fishing rights have raised the stakes, and China is now moving to assert its claim to the islands, contain the demonstrations at home, and respond forcefully to what it sees as a major Japanese provocation.?<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2012/09/anti-japan-protests-in-china/100370/\" rel=\"nofollow\">36 photos</a></p>\n<p>（点击图片放大）</p>\n<p><a title=\"【焦点大图】中国反日游行\" href=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/jpcn091712/s_i01_59021374.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/jpcn091712/s_i01_59021374.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"595\" height=\"400\" /></a><br />\nAn anti-Japan protester tears Japanese Rising Sun Flag during a rally outside the Japanese Consulate General in Hong Kong as they demanded that the Japanese government release Chinese activists arrested in Japan after landing on Uotsuri Island, one of the islands of Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese.?(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)</p>\n<p><a title=\"【焦点大图】中国反日游行\" href=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/jpcn091712/s_i02_RTR30U2M.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/jpcn091712/s_i02_RTR30U2M.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"595\" height=\"355\" /></a><br />\nUotsuri island, part of the disputed islands in the East China Sea, known as the Senkaku isles in Japan, Diaoyu islands in China, in the East China Sea, in this June 19, 2011 photo.
