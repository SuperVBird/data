Ever since China began to shuck<br />\noff communism and turn itself into a global economic power, its leaders have<br />\nfollowed the strategy of a “peaceful rise” — be modest, act prudently, don’t<br />\nfrighten the neighbors and certainly don’t galvanize any coalition against us.<br />\nBut in recent years, with the U.S. economic model having suffered an<br />\nembarrassing self-inflicted shock, and the “Beijing Consensus” humming along,<br />\nvoices have emerged in China saying “the future belongs to us” and maybe we<br />\nshould let the world, or at least the ’hood, know that a little more<br />\naffirmatively. For now, those voices come largely from retired generals and<br />\nedgy bloggers — and the Chinese leadership has remained cautious. But a<br />\ndiplomatic spat this past summer has China’s neighbors, not to mention<br />\nWashington, wondering for how long China will keep up the gentle giant act. <b>With an estimated 70 million bloggers,<br />\nChina’s leaders are under constant pressure now to be more assertive by a<br />\npopulist- and nationalist-leaning blogosphere</b>, which, in the absence of<br />\ndemocratic elections, is becoming the de facto voice of the people. </span></p>\n<p><span>The diplomatic fracas was a session of the regional forum<br />\nof the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, held July 23 in Hanoi.<br />\nIn attendance were foreign ministers of the 10 Asean members, as well as<br />\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton and China’s foreign minister, Yang Jiechi.<br />\nAccording to one of the diplomats who sat in on the meeting, the Asean<br />\nministers took turns subtly but firmly cautioning China to back off from its<br />\ndecision to claim “indisputable sovereignty” over the whole resource-rich South<br />\nChina Sea, which stretches from Singapore to the Strait of Taiwan over to<br />\nVietnam and carries about half the world’s merchant cargo each year. Its seabed<br />\nis also believed to hold major reserves of oil and gas, and lately China’s Navy<br />\nhas become more aggressive in seizing fishing boats alleged to have infringed<br />\non its sovereignty there. China also has been embroiled in maritime disputes<br />\nwith South Korea and Japan. </span></p>\n<p><span>As one minister after another got up at the Asean meeting<br />\nto assert claims in the South China Sea or argue that any territorial disputes<br />\nmust be resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law, the<br />\nChinese foreign minister grew increasingly agitated, according to a<br />\nparticipant. And after Mrs. Clinton spoke and insisted that the South China Sea<br />\nwas an area where America had “a national interest” in “freedom of navigation,”<br />\nthe Chinese foreign minister asked for a brief adjournment and then weighed in.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span>Speaking without a text, Yang went on for 25 minutes,<br />\ninsisting that this was a bilateral issue, not one between China and Asean. He<br />\nlooked across the room at Mrs. Clinton through much of his stem-winder, which<br />\nincluded the observation that “China is a big country” and most of the other<br />\nAsean members “are small countries,” The Washington Post reported. The<br />\nconsensus in the room, the diplomat said, was that the Chinese minister was<br />\ntrying to intimidate the group and separate the territorial claimants from the<br />\nnonclaimants so that there could be no Asean collective action and each country<br />\nwould have to negotiate with China separately. </span></p>\n<p><span>As negative feedback from the Yang lecture rippled back to<br />\nBeijing, China’s leaders seemed to play down the affair for fear that after a<br />\ndecade of declining U.S. influence in the region they were about to drive all<br />\ntheir neighbors back into America’s embrace. </span></p>\n<p><span>How much China’s leaders will be able to cool it, though,<br />\nwill depend, in part, on a third party: the Chinese blogosphere, where a whole<br />\ngeneration of Chinese schooled by the government on the notion that the U.S.<br />\nand the West want to keep China down, now have their own megaphones to denounce<br />\nany Chinese official who compromises too much as “pro-American” or “a traitor.”<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span>Interestingly, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing has begun to<br />\nreach out to that same blogosphere — even inviting bloggers to travel in the<br />\ncar with the U.S. ambassador, Jon Huntsman, and interview him when he visits<br />\ntheir Chinese province — <b>to get<br />\nAmerica’s message out without filtering by China’s state-run media</b>. </span></p>\n<p><span>“China for the first time has a public sphere to discuss<br />\neverything affecting Chinese citizens,” explained Hu Yong, a blogosphere expert<br />\nat Peking University. “Under traditional media, only elite people had a voice,<br />\nbut the Internet changed that.” He added, “We now have a transnational media.<br />\nIt is the whole society talking, so people from various regions of China can<br />\ndiscuss now when something happens in a remote village — and the news spreads<br />\neverywhere.” But this Internet world “is more populist and nationalistic,” he<br />\ncontinued. “Many years of education that our enemies are trying to keep us down<br />\nhas produced a whole generation of young people whose thinking is like this,<br />\nand they now have a whole Internet to express it.” </span></p>\n<p><span>Watch this space. <b>The<br />\ndays when Nixon and Mao could manage this relationship in secret are long gone.</b><br />\n<b>There are a lot of unstable chemicals at<br />\nwork out here today, and so many more players with the power to inflame or calm<br />\nU.S.-China relations. Or to paraphrase Princess Diana, there are three of us in<br />\nthis marriage.</b> </span></p>\n<h6><span>A version of this op-ed appeared in print on September 15, 2010, on page<br />\nA35 of the New York edition.</span></h6>\n</div>\n","author":176,"categories":[9203],"tags":[]}
