Considering the tens of millions of religious followers in its transitioning society, there is indeed no surprise to see the emergence of such problems. However, the key issue here is the lack of any single legislation on religions by China&#8217;s legislature institutions. It is clear that religions in China have not been on the track of the rule of law. Simply denying this fact will not help improve the situation.  Hence, the reality faced by the Chinese government, religious organizations and followers, as well as the entire society is that on one hand there are numerous problems and disputes in the religious field, while on the other hand there are no laws to regulate and tackle these problems. Moreover, although there are multiple government agencies that deal with religious affairs, they remain stranded in terms of solving hot and difficult religious issues that have existed over the past decades.</p>\n<p><strong>　　The Misidentifying and Demonization of the Rebel Groups During the Cultural Revolution</strong></p>\n<p>　　The conservative Red Guards targeted the lower strata, and the rebel groups of the Red Guards aimed at the rulers. Whoever witnessed this period of history should not have confused the two. However, with the government&#8217;s deepening efforts on reestablishing the order and the rise of the general public&#8217;s reflections on the movement after the Cultural Revolution, historical amnesia have spread among some people who blur the lines between the initial and second stages of the Cultural Revolution, neglecting the differences of struggle of classes and struggle between two lines and confusing the two types of Red Guards. These people include the victims as well as the participants of the Cultural Revolution.</p>\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/files/2012/06/14df7b52EKCgBk8MZdE.gif.gif\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=b4fd4ae247\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/mstlf\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":997,"categories":[18269,20534],"tags":[16910]}
