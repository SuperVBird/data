Tutu<br />\nFriday, October 22, 2010; A27 </span><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Immediately after the imprisoned writer <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/08/AR2010100801502.html\">Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize this month</a>,<br />\nfor more than two decades of pursuing democratic change in China, the Chinese<br />\ngovernment responded by calling him a criminal and accusing the Nobel Committee<br />\nof blasphemy. It sent security agents to the Beijing apartment of his wife, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/15/AR2009041502901.html\">Liu Xia</a>, took away her mobile phone and placed her under<br />\nhouse arrest. We have seen this before: in the dark days of apartheid, under<br />\nthe long shadow of the Iron Curtain. Whenever we took a small step toward<br />\nsecuring the freedom of our people, we were stripped of our own. </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we write, Liu remains cloistered in a remote prison in northeast China.<br />\nThis fourth prison sentence of 11 years came after he co-authored <a href=\"http://www.hrichina.org/public/\">Charter 08</a>, a<br />\ndocument calling on the Chinese government to institute democratic reforms and<br />\nguarantee the freedoms of assembly, religion and expression. Though Charter 08<br />\nwas modeled after Czechoslovakia&#8217;s Charter &#8217;77, the fundamental values it<br />\ninvokes are no more Western than they are Chinese. </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">We nominated Liu for the Nobel Peace Prize this year because of the<br />\nuniversality of his call for fundamental freedoms for his people. </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">At its core, Charter 08 asks the Chinese government to honor rights<br />\nenshrined in the Chinese Constitution. The government has already signed the<br />\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and ratified the<br />\nInternational Covenant on Economic and Social Rights. In a <a href=\"http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1010/03/fzgps.01.html\">recent<br />\ninterview with CNN</a>, premier Wen Jiabao acknowledged that &#8220;Freedom of<br />\nspeech is indispensable. . . . The people&#8217;s wishes for, and needs for,<br />\ndemocracy and freedom are irresistible.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">This need not be a moment of shame or insult for China. This should be a<br />\nmoment of pride, celebrating the fact that one of China&#8217;s own is recognized as<br />\nthe world&#8217;s greatest contributor to that which all nations seek: peace. It is<br />\nan affirmation of one of humankind&#8217;s oldest living languages that Liu&#8217;s words<br />\nin Charter 08, Chinese words, could inspire such admiration. It is a testament<br />\nto the strength and courage of the Chinese people that Liu&#8217;s actions have<br />\nearned such widespread respect. </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Despite its initial reaction, this remains an opportunity for the Chinese<br />\ngovernment to turn the page on a century of victimization. We know that many<br />\nwrongs have been perpetrated against China and its people throughout history.<br />\nBut awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu is not one of them. Nor is the<br />\npeaceful call for reform from the more than 10,000 Chinese citizens who dared<br />\nto sign Charter 08. </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Today, more than at any other time in history, the world looks to China as<br />\na leader. China has a chance to show that it is a forward-looking nation, as it<br />\nhas been for thousands of years. If it keeps Liu behind bars, the Chinese<br />\ngovernment is no more progressive than the ever paranoid and closeted Burmese<br />\njunta, the only other regime with the gall to lock away another recipient of<br />\nthe Nobel Peace Prize, Aung San Suu Kyi. Release Liu, and China continues its<br />\nimpressive emergence on the world stage. Beijing helped keep the global economy<br />\nafloat amid recent crisis; now it can show the world that it has the confidence<br />\nto face criticism and embrace change. </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">China has made such brave strides before. Thirty years ago, while we were<br />\nstill being punished simply for speaking our minds, the Chinese government<br />\nopened up its economy and unleashed the industriousness and ingenuity of the<br />\nChinese people on the world&#8217;s markets. The world has watched with awe as China<br />\npulled itself out of poverty and into a thriving, dynamic future. This is a<br />\nmoment for China to open up once again, to give its people the ability to<br />\ncompete in the marketplace of ideas where they will surely prove just as<br />\nextraordinary. </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">We have seen this story in the churches of Soweto and the theaters of<br />\nPrague. We know how it ends. We are able to write today, free of fear and full<br />\nof hope, because our people won our freedom back. In time, Liu and the Chinese<br />\npeople will win their freedom. </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">After Liu&#8217;s sentencing last year, he said in a statement: &#8220;I have<br />\nlong been aware that when an independent intellectual stands up to an<br />\nautocratic state, step one toward freedom is often a step into prison. Now I am<br />\ntaking that step; and true freedom is that much nearer.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Chinese government can continue to fight a losing battle, against the<br />\nforces of democracy and freedom that its own premier recently called<br />\n&#8220;irresistible.&#8221; Or it can stand on the side of justice, free Liu<br />\nXiaobo and immediately end the house arrest imposed on his wife. </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">Václav Havel is a former president of the Czech Republic.
