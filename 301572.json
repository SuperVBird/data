Jury members called him an inspiration to young people<br />\nin China.</span></p>\n<p><span>At the beginning<br />\nof 2013, Li Chengpeng saw his name hit the headlines outside of his native<br />\nChina while on tour to promote his book &#8220;The World Knows.&#8221; Afraid<br />\nthat his fans could turn a book-signing event into a political rally, he was<br />\nonly permitted to hold what he called &#8220;silent book readings&#8221; as<br />\nauthorities allowed him to sign fans&apos; books but not speak with them or read<br />\nfrom his collection of essays.</span></p>\n<p><span>Writing<br />\non the Chinese microblogging service Sina Weibo, Li said the authorities<br />\n&#8220;are all crazy&#8221; and when he appeared for the book signing he didn&apos;t<br />\nsay a word but wore a shirt that said &#8220;I love you all&#8221; to thank his<br />\nfans.</span></p>\n<p><span>And he<br />\nhas a lot of fans. Over 7 million people follow Li&apos;s posts at<br />\nhttp://blog.sina.com.cn/lichengpeng and young people in particular listen to what<br />\nhe has to say. In November 2012, he gave a speech at the University of Beijing<br />\nwhere he told students that Chinese people had been unlearning how to speak for<br />\ndecades. His speech made its way around the Internet and the political nature<br />\nof his views became clear.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;I<br />\nam only pushing to get the right to speak and to write,&#8221; he said.</span></p>\n<p><span>His<br />\ncriticism of the poor state of freedom of expression in China is seen as both<br />\ndescriptive and sharp.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Whenever<br />\nofficials announce that our country publishes the most books and magazines, I<br />\nthink that our country is the one that produces the most toilet paper,&#8221; he<br />\nsaid.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>A new form<br />\nof protest</span><span></span></p>\n<p><span>In his<br />\nmid-40s, Li is not among China&apos;s youngest bloggers, but he is a part of a new<br />\nculture of protest developing in the country. Individuals no longer have to<br />\nstand up to injustices alone and instead identify problems and publicize them<br />\nto engage a wider section of the public. Issues can range from the acts of a<br />\ncorrupt local politician to companies cutting corners in construction projects.</span></p>\n<p><span>Li saw<br />\nhow shoddy construction caused a building to collapse in May 2008 and witnessed<br />\nhow victims could not be rescued from the remains as the site was too dangerous<br />\nfor others to enter. He wrote that he could not understand how in a region<br />\nprone to earthquakes, buildings that collapse at the slightest movement of the<br />\nground were allowed to be put up.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;The<br />\nthing that still makes me wonder,&#8221; he wrote in his blog four years later,<br />\n&#8220;is the question of why all the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks<br />\nhave names, while no one has the names of the children there.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>He<br />\nassembled a group of people who then traveled through the region to evaluate<br />\nthe building materials used in schools. Of the many places they visited, they<br />\nfound one building that remained standing after the quake and in which all the<br />\nteachers and students survived. The press was amazed that anything could<br />\nwithstand the earthquake, but Li discovered that the building was one of the<br />\nfew in the region built in accordance with construction requirements and<br />\npublished an essay titled &#8220;The truth about the amazing survival of<br />\nstudents and teachers at the Longhan primary school.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Patriotism&apos;s<br />\nmany sides</span><span></span></p>\n<p><span>Li was<br />\nnot always an opponent of the government. He started his media career as a<br />\nsports commentator and was a &#8220;patriot&#8221; unwilling to criticize<br />\nauthorities and happy to believe that only evil could possibly come from the<br />\nWest, he has said of himself. After watching a building&apos;s collapse result in<br />\nthe deaths of hundreds of people, Li said he realized patriotism meant working<br />\nto protect his country and the lives of the people in it.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;If<br />\nat the end of my life, I write an autobiography,&#8221; he said on his blog,<br />\n&#8220;when I got to the year 2008, I would write, &apos;Before now, I was an<br />\nidiot.&apos;&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>Li&apos;s<br />\npassion became telling the uncomfortable truths of daily life in China in a<br />\nsatirical and ironic way that grabs people&apos;s attention. One of his first books<br />\naddressed the lives of people forcibly displaced from their homes and their<br />\nfights against being moved against their will.</span></p>\n<p><span>In 2010,<br />\nhe tried to run as an independent candidate in parliamentary elections, and<br />\nwhile that course of action is legally available to every Chinese person,<br />\npeople who are not members of the Communist Party do not stand a chance of<br />\nbeing successful. Still, his campaign made authorities uneasy and in exchange<br />\nthey made his life difficult. A sports scholarship was taken away from his son,<br />\na talented tennis player, and Li, of course, was not elected to parliament.</span></p>\n<p><span>Li&apos;s<br />\nfresh take on problems in China and his courage in publicizing them convinced<br />\nthis year&apos;s jury at The Bobs to honor him with the annual contest&apos;s top prize.<br />\nChinese jury member Hu Yong, a blogger and journalist himself, said he has been<br />\ncontinually impressed by Li&apos;s campaigns and entertaining style of writing that<br />\ngets attention.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;He<br />\ngives young people a very good example how to influence the future cause of<br />\nChina,&#8221; Hu said. &#8220;The award shows that the jury members also think<br />\nthat a blogger like Li Chengpeng can influence millions of young Chinese people<br />\nto let them be aware of the censorship, to be more free, more open and to be<br />\nmore active in political process.&#8221;</span></p>\n<div>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>·<span>      <br />\n</span></span><b><span>Date</span></b><span> 07.05.2013</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>·<span>      <br />\n</span></span><b><span>Author</span></b><span> Silke Wünsch / sms</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>·<span>      <br />\n</span></span><b><span>Editor </span></b><span>Jessie Wingard</span></p>\n</div>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=b4fd4ae247\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/mstlf\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
