Professor Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson<br />\nInstitute of International Economics in Washington, responded in a<br />\nVoxEU column last night (text included at the end of this email for<br />\nyour reference).<br />\n <br />\nAll the best,<br />\n <br />\nYiping<br />\n <br />\nYiping Huang<br />\nChina Macroeconomic Research Center<br />\n <br />\n=====================<br />\n <br />\nChina’s currency and the US economy<br />\n <br />\nFred Bergsten<br />\n1 November 2010</p>\n<p>Yiping Huang recently argued that the US would not win a<br />\ncurrency war over global imbalances. This column agrees that a<br />\ncurrency or trade war would be lose-lose. But it says that such a<br />\nconflict is inevitable unless the root causes of the growing<br />\nimbalances are addressed</p>\n<p>\nIn a 19 October column on this site, “A currency war the US cannot<br />\nwin”, Yiping Huang argued that comprehensive policy packages in<br />\nChina and the US, including but ranging well beyond exchange rate<br />\nrealignment, are required to achieve the needed global rebalancing.<br />\nHe also argued that progress is already being made on both counts<br />\n(Huang 2010).<br />\nProfessor Huang is clearly correct on both points. The US must<br />\nincrease its saving rate, and the household number has risen from<br />\nzero before the crisis to about 6% now. China can achieve real<br />\nappreciation of its currency by letting wages rise at a rapid pace,<br />\nas is now occurring.<br />\nProfessor Huang is only partially correct, however, in arguing that<br />\nthe imbalances themselves have improved. To be sure, both the<br />\nChinese surplus and the US deficit were cut roughly in half from<br />\n2006/07 to 2009. This was a result of two things. First, the global<br />\nrecession reduced imbalances, as exports and imports retracted by<br />\nroughly equal percentages. Second, with the usual time lag of 2-3<br />\nyears, the currency realignments of 20%-25% by the dollar during<br />\n2002-07 and of the renminbi during 2005-2008. Incidentally,<br />\ncontrary to Professor Huang’s assertion that I ignore this<br />\nprogress, I emphasised both improvements in my testimony to the<br />\nHouse Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Banking Committee in<br />\nmid-September.1<br />\nBut the imbalances are now rising sharply again, which is why the<br />\nissue has soared to the top of the global agenda. The US global<br />\ncurrent-account deficit has moved about halfway back up from its<br />\nrecent trough of $300 billion to its record high of $800 billion.<br />\nChina’s global trade surplus over the past several months is more<br />\nthan 75% above its level of a year earlier and the IMF projects<br />\nthat its global current-account surplus will continue rising back<br />\nto 8% of GDP (about $800 billion, equal to the largest US deficit<br />\nto date) by 2015 on the basis of current exchange rates and other<br />\npolicies. This goes against the rebalancing strategy agreed upon by<br />\nthe G20, including the leaders of China and the US. It also goes<br />\nagainst the economic needs of both countries, with the US<br />\nexperiencing slow growth and China expressing deep concern over<br />\noverheating. The issue is thus much more urgent, and considerably<br />\nmore serious, than suggested by Professor Huang.<br />\nThere are several other major analytical errors in his article that<br />\nhave an important bearing on the topic. For example, he suggests<br />\nthat revaluation of the renminbi would not produce net economic<br />\nbenefits for the US. There would be costs, to be sure, mainly from<br />\nhigher prices, yet these are not serious in the short to medium<br />\nrun, however, due to low capacity utilisation and the total absence<br />\nof inflationary pressures. On the other hand, my colleague William<br />\nCline has shown that revaluation of even 20% would curb China’s<br />\nglobal surplus by $350-500 billion and reduce the US global deficit<br />\nby $50-$120 billion, which would translate into 300,000-700,000<br />\ngood US jobs (Cline 2010). Under current and foreseeable conditions<br />\nof high unemployment and price stability, currency realignment<br />\nwould thus represent a significant and unambiguous net benefit for<br />\nthe US economy.<br />\nProfessor Huang also argues that the Plaza Agreement of 1985 failed<br />\nto rectify the contemporary global imbalances, the highest to date<br />\nbefore the current period. To the contrary, again with the usual<br />\nlags, the US global deficit virtually disappeared by 1990-91 and<br />\nthe Japanese surplus dropped very sharply as well. Those imbalances<br />\nrose again only when the dollar appreciated sharply, by 40% from<br />\n1995 to 2002, and the yen became hugely undervalued in real terms<br />\nas a result of the deflation that characterised the Japanese<br />\neconomy from 1991 forward.<br />\nWith respect to my own proposal for countervailing currency<br />\nintervention, under which the US would sell dollars to offset the<br />\nexchange-rate impact of China’s purchases of dollars (Bergsten<br />\n2010), Professor Huang is correct that the inconvertibility of the<br />\nrenminbi makes it impossible to fully offset China’s massive<br />\nmanipulation. But the US authorities could buy proxies, such as<br />\nnon-deliverable forwards and renminbi-denominated bonds, to the<br />\nextent they are available and send unmistakeable signals to both<br />\nthe private markets and the Chinese authorities that the time has<br />\ncome to cease resisting the economic fundamentals. This approach,<br />\nwhich is aimed at filling the crucial absence of effective systemic<br />\nresponses to chronic surpluses countries that keep their currencies<br />\nundervalued (like Japan in the past) and would obviously work<br />\nbetter against convertible currencies, is tailored precisely to the<br />\nproblem it seeks to address and is far superior to erecting new<br />\ntrade barriers.<br />\nProfessor Huang is certainly right that no one would win a currency<br />\nor trade war. But the root causes of today’s large and growing<br />\nimbalances, especially the Chinese surplus due to China’s huge and<br />\nprolonged manipulation of its currency, must be resolved soon or<br />\nelse such conflict is inevitable. The upcoming G20 summit in Seoul<br />\nmay offer a “last best chance” to avoid irreversible reactions in<br />\nthe US Congress and other countries.<br />\nReferences<br />\nBergsten, C Fred (2010), “We Can Fight Fire with Fire on the<br />\nRenminbi”, Financial Times, 4 October.<br />\nCline, William R (2010). “Renminbi Undervaluation, China’s Surplus,<br />\nand the US Trade Deficit”, Peterson Institute for International<br />\nEconomics Policy Brief 10-20.<br />\nHuang, Yiping (2010), “A currency war the US cannot win”,<br />\nVoxEU.org, 19 October.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1 U.S. House. 2010.
