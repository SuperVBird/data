An uproar on Weibo,<br />\nChina&#39;s answer to Twitter, pushed authorities to free Tang days later.</span><span></span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><i><span>November 27, 2012</span></i><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><i><span><br /></span></i></p>\n<p><span>Never have so many Chinese<br />\npeople spoken so freely than on Weibo, China&#39;s answer to Twitter. Just 4 years<br />\nold, the series of microblog services now has more than 400 million users.</span></p>\n<p><span>And, increasingly, Chinese are<br />\nusing it to expose corruption, criticize officials and try to make their<br />\ncountry a better place — even as China&#39;s Communist Party tries to control the<br />\nWeibo revolution.</span></p>\n<p><span>Were it not for Weibo, you<br />\nwould never know Tang Hui&#39;s extraordinary story. She wouldn&#39;t be free to tell<br />\nit; she&#39;d be sitting in a Chinese re-education-through-labor camp eating<br />\nporridge.</span></p>\n<p><span>Instead, Tang is at home in<br />\nHunan province, sharing her Kafka-esque tale.</span></p>\n<p><span>It began in 2006, when a pimp<br />\nlured her then-11-year-old daughter into a brothel in the central Chinese city<br />\nof Yongzhou.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;He said, &#39;If you cry, I<br />\nam going to go kill your mom. I know where your mother&#39;s business is, and I<br />\nknow your mother,&#39; &#8221; Tang recalls.</span></p>\n<p><span>The fifth-grader was forced to<br />\nservice scores of clients. After three months, Tang got a tip about her<br />\ndaughter&#39;s location and called the cops.</span></p>\n<p><span>But Tang says the first officer<br />\nto arrive at the brothel never got out of his car. And even after she convinced<br />\npolice to rescue her daughter, they wouldn&#39;t arrest anyone.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;We demanded they take<br />\nnotes when interviewing my child. They repeatedly refused. They said this was<br />\nnot a criminal case,&#8221; she says.</span></p>\n<p><span>Later, Tang found out why the<br />\npolice were so reluctant: The brothel owner had an uncle who was a top official<br />\nin the local prosecutor&#39;s office.</span></p>\n<p><span>A court did eventually convict<br />\nthe brothel staff. But over the years, Tang continued to demand public<br />\npunishment for the police who tried to shield them.</span></p>\n<p><span>In August of this year, the<br />\npolice had had enough and called Tang. When she arrived at the station, there<br />\nwere seven or eight &#8220;special forces&#8221; police to guard her.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;They asked me to sit in a<br />\nchair for interrogation. I spent a night in the chair and didn&#39;t sleep at<br />\nall,&#8221; she says.</span></p>\n<p><span>At 7:30 the next morning, they<br />\ngave her a document, notifying her that she would be sent to<br />\nre-education-through-labor camp. For 18 months. No lawyer. No trial.</span></p>\n<p><span>Before the cops hauled her off,<br />\nTang called her attorney, who posted the news to his Weibo account.</span></p>\n<p><span>Within days, Tang&#39;s story had<br />\nreached more than 30 million Weibo users — and they were furious. A torrent of<br />\ncriticism followed, overwhelming the local police.</span></p>\n<p><span>After 10 days, the state-run<br />\nChina Central Television announced Tang&#39;s release.</span></p>\n<p><span>Just a few years ago, Tang<br />\nsays, this couldn&#39;t have happened.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Weibo had a very big<br />\nimpact on my situation because our local government tried to cover up this case<br />\nand not let the public know,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But this time, people around<br />\nChina and even around the world found out they put me in labor camp. And the<br />\nlocal government couldn&#39;t resist so many people&#39;s power.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Powerful Tool</span></strong><span></span></p>\n<p><span>Weibo is changing the way<br />\nChinese communicate and has become a major source of news in China.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Any local news can<br />\nimmediately become national news,&#8221; says<span> </span></span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/huyong\"><span>Hu Yong</span></a></span><span>, a professor at Peking University&#39;s School of Journalism and<br />\nCommunication.</span></p>\n<p><span>Adds<span> </span></span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/isaac\"><span>Isaac Mao</span></a></span><span>, one of China&#39;s first bloggers: &#8220;Weibo is the battleground<br />\nbetween the authority and freedom-thinking people.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>Hu says Weibo has also become a<br />\npowerful new tool for ordinary people to protect their rights.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Before the emergence of<br />\nWeibo, local people actually had limited channels to try to solve their<br />\nproblems. Weibo is kind of pressure politics on local government<br />\nofficials,&#8221; he says.</span></p>\n<p><span>In recent months,<br />\nWeibo campaigns have triggered a number of firings.

Observers call it &#8220;Weibo Justice.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Why does China&#39;s famously<br />\nthin-skinned regime put up with such criticism?</span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/mranti\"><span>Michael Anti</span></a></span><span>, a prominent Chinese political commentator, says that when the<br />\ncriticism is directed at local officials, those attacks actually serve the<br />\ncentral government.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Chinese have a longtime<br />\nmyth that the emperor is good, all the thugs are local. So that myth is<br />\nimportant to keep the regime&#39;s legitimacy,&#8221; Anti says. &#8220;I think Weibo<br />\njustice is a showcase for the government to tell the people [that] the emperor<br />\n&#8230; is still good.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>On occasion, the party will<br />\neven allow Netizens — or<span> </span><em>Wangmin</em>, as they are known in Chinese —<br />\nto attack high-ranking officials it wants to get rid of.</span></p>\n<p><span>That&#39;s what happened to<br />\nthen-Chongqing Communist Party boss Bo Xilai, who was lobbying for a top post<br />\nin Beijing before his<span> </span></span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/28/161992377/disgraced-chinese-politician-gets-booted-from-party\"><span>spectacular downfall</span></a></span><span><span> </span></span><span>this year and had many enemies.</span></p>\n<p><span>After Bo&#39;s police chief hid out<br />\nin a U.S. Consulate earlier this year, Anti says it was open season on Weibo.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;You can joke about Bo<br />\nXilai and Chongqing city, about everything. Weibo became a very convenient<br />\nplatform,&#8221; Anti says.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Beyond Politics</span></strong><span></span></p>\n<p><span>This isn&#39;t to say there isn&#39;t<br />\ncensorship when it comes to sensitive political or human rights topics —<span> </span></span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/04/30/151670969/after-dissident-escapes-china-clamps-down-on-social-media\"><span>there is, and plenty of it</span></a></span><span>. And the party won&#39;t tolerate anything it remotely sees as a<br />\nthreat. Authorities detained a Beijing blogger earlier this month after<span> </span></span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/21/china-arrest-blogger-twitter-joke\"><span>he jokingly imagined</span></a></span><span><span> </span></span><span>the recent party leadership congress as a horror movie in which<br />\nthe delegates die en masse.</span></p>\n<p><span>But, like most Americans, most<br />\nChinese don&#39;t use Weibo for politics. They use it to pursue their interests<br />\nand, sometimes, to help strangers who share them.</span></p>\n<p><span>Take the case of Richard Sears,<br />\na retired computer programmer from Tennessee. For the past 22 years, he has<br />\nbeen working on a website on the etymology of Chinese characters.</span></p>\n<p><span>Sears came to China this year<br />\nto do research for his website, a personal hobby. But he says because of bad<br />\ninformation, his tourist visa was canceled in August.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;[The authorities]<br />\nconfiscated my passport. I found myself with 10 days to get out of the country.<br />\nAt that point, I figured I would have to go home and never come back to<br />\nChina,&#8221; he says.</span></p>\n<p><span>Sears had one thing going for<br />\nhim: his Weibo connections.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;I had a few friends on<br />\nWeibo — I didn&#39;t realize how many friends I had on Weibo — but I told a couple<br />\nof my friends about it and then suddenly, within a couple of days, there were<br />\n40,000 retweets.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>Job possibilities poured in<br />\nfrom Chinese supporters trying to help Sears stay in the country. Last week,<br />\nSears arrived back in Beijing with a work visa and a job teaching physics and<br />\ndoing Chinese language research at Beijing Normal University.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Without Weibo, this would<br />\nhave been impossible,&#8221; Sears says.</span></p>\n<p><span>Weibo is still in its infancy.<br />\nChina&#39;s government and the microblog companies themselves employ an army of<br />\ncensors every day to manage and shape its growth.</span></p>\n<p><span>Sears isn&#39;t sure how Weibo will<br />\nultimately evolve. But he thinks the potential is huge.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=2ea93c5b7b\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/msuvD\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
