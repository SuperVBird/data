From now on, any service that accesses Google’s Contacts API — which makes it easy to import your list of friends’ and coworkers’ email addresses into another service — will need to offer reciprocity. Facebook doesn’t, so it’s going to lose access to this key piece of the social graph.</p>\n<p>So what does that mean in layman’s terms?  When you initially sign up for Facebook, you’re run through a series of prompts asking you to enter your Google account information so that Facebook can import the email addresses of your contacts. This is a very powerful feature because it helps new users instantly connect with dozens of their friends. And Google is turning it off, because it thinks Facebook isn’t playing fair.</p>\n<p>You see, Facebook has never allowed users to export the contact information of their friends.</p></div>\n<p><img src=\"http://img.tongji.linezing.com/1017243/tongji.gif\" /><img src=\"http://img.tongji.linezing.com/997968/tongji.gif\" /></p>\n","author":176,"categories":[9203],"tags":[]}
