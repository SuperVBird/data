Investment may be powering the Chinese economy but experiments like Oreo’s gum cookie, a cookie with a glob of gum sandwiched neatly between a pair of Oreo’s iconic dark chocolate biscuits instead of the creamy white “stuff”, which for better or worse never made it to store shelves, are a reminder that consumption is rising sharply.?(Reuters/Aly Song)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/china061912/s_c44_RTR33UPO.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/china061912/s_c44_RTR33UPO.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />A patient is stung by a bee as he receives an apitherapy treatment at a hospital in Zhengzhou, Henan province, on June 18, 2012. Apitherapy is one of the ancient methods of curing diseases by using honey, pollen, bee bread, propolis, royal jelly, apilarnil and bee venom. The therapy is claimed to be of use in several types of arthritis, neurological problems such as insomnia, migraine headaches, and neuritis, and skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and herpes.?(Reuters/China Daily)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/china061912/s_c45_RTR31RFF.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/china061912/s_c45_RTR31RFF.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />A worker paints a single-seater submarine designed by Zhang Wuyi and his fellow engineers at a shipyard in Wuhan, Hubei province, on May 7, 2012. Zhang, a 37-year-old local farmer, who is interested in scientific inventions, has made six miniature submarines with several fellow engineers, one of which was sold to a businessman in Dalian at a price of 100,000 yuan ($15,855) last October. The submarines, mainly designed for harvesting aquatic products, such as sea cucumber, have a diving depth of 20-30 meters, and can travel for 10 hours, local media reported.?(Reuters/Stringer)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/china061912/s_c46_26025685.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/china061912/s_c46_26025685.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />A woman plants rice in Yingjiang, near the Myanmar border, in Yunnan Province, China, on May 26, 2012.
