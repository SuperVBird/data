Mr Yu, a 26-year-old policeman, describes himself as conservative and is looking for a woman with “traditional virtues”. His attendance at the expo, the city’s largest yet, is a long shot; he would prefer a marriage set up by colleagues or by his parents. It worked for them 30 years ago, he says.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the vast expo park, Fancy Huang is arguing with her mother. At 25, Ms Huang (who chose her English name herself) is two years shy of the dreaded age at which she will be branded a <em>shengnu, </em>or “leftover woman”. Her cousins are all married, so her parents are applying pressure. Ms Huang’s mother is stewing. “Sometimes my daughter says she would rather buy a flat by herself and live alone,” she says. “It’s so bizarre.”</p>\n<p>Mr Yu and Ms Huang are just two of the thousands of young people trying to navigate China’s modern marriage market. At the expo there is no shortage of assistance. On one stage, a glamorous woman in a fuchsia minidress is hosting a public matchmaking session. A bachelor comes onstage and sings a song to 12 female contestants who hold up paddles with either a smiley or a sad face. Elsewhere, mass speed-dating events are under way. Dating agencies vie for singles to sign up. Their websites are wildly popular in China. One such site, Jiayuan, is listed on America’s NASDAQ stockmarket.</p>\n<p>In the past 30 years the Chinese search for a spouse has, like so much else, been transformed. Confucian thought emphasised a match’s significance for society rather than for the individuals involved. Though formal arranged marriages were banned in 1950, parents and colleagues continued well into the new century to help couples pair up (some still do).</p>\n<p>The recent decline of such practices, especially in cities, in favour of choosing your own mate, has coincided with huge demographic shifts. China’s skewed birth ratio (118 boys to every 100 girls) means that there will be a surplus of about 24m bachelors by 2020. And women’s increasing socio-economic freedom makes them pickier when choosing a husband.</p>\n<p>Mr Yu, the traditionalist, remains hopeful. “We just haven’t been in the right place at the right time,” he says of his putative partner. Other bachelors are less patient. Last month, the “Multi-Millionaire Seeking Spouses in Ten Cities Show” launched in the southern city of Guangzhou. Eleven Chinese millionaires are paying a luxury matchmaking agency 5m yuan ($790,000) for assistance. One of them, a billionaire, has particular requirements: suitable candidates should be aged 20-26, weigh less than 50kg (110lb) and have no sexual experience. So far more than 5,000 young women have applied.</p>\n<p><strong>== ALL RIGHTS RESERVED FOR THE ECONOMIST NEWSPAPER LIMITED ==</strong></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21556621\">link</a></p>\n<p> <img src=\"http://omm.hk/?ak_action=api_record_view&#038;id=12039&#038;type=feed\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<hr>\n<p><small>© lamb for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://omm.hk\">新闻理想档案馆</a>, 2012/06/12. | <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://omm.hk/%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%AD%A6%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%9A%E5%AF%BB%E6%89%BE%E7%9C%9F%E7%88%B1.html\">Permalink</a> |<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://omm.hk/category/%E6%94%B6%E5%90%AC%E6%95%8C%E5%8F%B0\" title=\"查看 收听敌台 中的全部文章\">收听敌台</a> <br /> Post tags: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://omm.hk/tag/%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%AD%A6%E4%BA%BA\">经济学人</a><br /> </small></p>\n<p> <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://zhan.renren.com/mediadream\">New：！我们建立了OMM人人小站！欢迎关注！</a></strong> | <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://t.sina.com.cn/ohmm\">OMM通讯社@新浪微博</a></strong> | <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://twitter.com/ohmymedia\">OhMyMedia@Twitter</a></strong> | <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://t.qq.com/OMMinfo\">OMM通讯社@腾讯微博</a></strong> | <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://t.163.com/ohmymedia\">OMM通讯社@网易微博</a></strong> <br /> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ohmymedia.info/?page_id=3165\"><strong>加入我们，OMM通讯社志愿者招募！</strong></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oh-my-media/~4/cOIoyj_KRQI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=7fb38f1f49\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/mss45\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18269,20534],"tags":[16910]}
