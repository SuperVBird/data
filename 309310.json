Those who prefer to read research reports<br />\ninstead of tea leaves will draw similar conclusions after reading OSF’s<br />\nrecently-published<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/mapping-digital-media-china\"><span>Mapping Digital Media China<br />\nreport</span></a> &#8211; even though it was completed well before the<br />\nleadership transition. According to the report’s authors, the emergence over<br />\nthe past decade of a “vibrant online civil society” in China provides grounds<br />\nfor optimism in the long run. Yet this vibrant online world will continue to<br />\ncoexist with a “sophisticated party-state propaganda and control system” whose<br />\ngrip on broadcast media, licensing of digital services, spectrum allocation, and<br />\nprofessional news content production shows few signs of loosening.</span></p>\n<p><span>Indeed,<br />\nanalysis of last week’s 18th Communist Party Conference indicates an intention<br />\nto maintain as firm a grip as possible. In a<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://http//www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/16/opportunity_lost?page=full\"><span>thorough examination</span></a> of<br />\nthe of the<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1083397/seven-men-who-rule-billion\"><span>new CCP Standing Committee</span></a>, Cheng<br />\nLi, a scholar of Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution in Washington<br />\nDC, pointed out that key liberals in the Politburo, particularly<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/about/centers/china/top-future-leaders/li_yuanchao\"><span>Li  Yuanchao</span></a> who<br />\nis known to support liberal intellectual demands for rule of law and greater<br />\ngovernment accountability, were not promoted to the Standing Committee as<br />\nexpected. Cheng concludes that “China’s much-needed political reform may be<br />\ndelayed.”  And without political reform, meaningful media reform is<br />\nunlikely.</span></p>\n<p><span>Chinese<br />\nproponents of free expression and media reform are also disheartened by the<br />\nelevation of Liu Yunshan, head of the propaganda department, known as a<br />\nfaithful enforcer of party discipline on the media. His efforts to bring the<br />\nInternet to heel have included a licensing system for online service providers<br />\nand a requirement that microbloggers register their accounts with their real<br />\nnames and ID numbers.

They cite government survey data indicating that<br />\nroughly 30 percent of the internet-using population – about 10 percent of the<br />\nnation’s total population – actively participate in online discussions or post<br />\ntheir own opinions and observations online. The report also reminds us that the<br />\nmajority of Chinese people have yet to use the internet at all: “the internet<br />\nis still beyond the reach of 800 million Chinese who rely almost exclusively on<br />\ntelevision for their information and entertainment, in particular the mammoth<br />\nstate broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV).” </span></p>\n<p><span>China’s news organizations – particularly the<br />\n more commercially-oriented ones serving local and regional markets – like<br />\nnews organizations everywhere, are working hard to innovate through creative<br />\nuse of digital technologies. However their ability to conduct independent<br />\ninvestigative journalism, and actually publish or broadcast these<br />\ninvestigations in their newspapers or on television, is severely constrained by<br />\nstrong party and government controls. Individual journalists have been able to<br />\nuse blogs and microblogs as an alternative distribution channel for some news<br />\nand information, though the result is that news organizations do not directly<br />\nbenefit from their staff’s most cutting-edge investigative talents. Meanwhile,<br />\nwebsites that are not part of government-approved news organizations are not<br />\nallowed to conduct original news reporting – although online media companies<br />\nare constantly seeking ways to subtly get around the strict rules about who can<br />\nreport news under what circumstances, particularly on local stories.</span></p>\n<p><span>When it comes to television – which remains<br />\nthe most important and powerful form of media for the majority of Chinese – the<br />\ngovernment naturally controls the switchover process from analog signal to<br />\ndigital. It also controls which companies are allowed to participate in the<br />\nprovision of bundled internet, voice, and digital TV services – as well as who<br />\nis allowed to create what sorts of content disseminated through these services.<br />\nThe same of course goes for mobile services of all kinds. When it comes to<br />\nallocation of spectrum, politics “plays a decisive role in spectrum allocation<br />\npolicies.” There is no notion of “public service media” independent of party<br />\nand state which “view themselves as the overseers of the public interest.” Yet<br />\nthere is no process by which the bureaucracy – often a patchwork of different<br />\nagencies and departments – determines the broader public interest as they go<br />\nabout creating and enforcing rules and regulations.</span></p>\n<p><span>The report makes a number of<br />\nrecommendations: </span></p>\n<p><span>&#8211; Media literacy. With “hundreds of millions<br />\nof people with little knowledge or understanding of how the media are used and<br />\nhow they might use the media,” greater media literacy education for all ages<br />\nwould “help educate people to participate in public life so that the<br />\nopportunities which digitization brings can be more widely enjoyed.”</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8211; Relaxation of government and party controls<br />\non media. This would make it more possible for journalists to carry out<br />\nindependent, investigative journalism that would hold authorities accountable<br />\nto the public interest.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8211; Constrain local government abuse of power<br />\nover media. The central government should take “measures to end the pattern of<br />\nviolent retribution, harassment and victimization meted out to journalists or<br />\nwhistleblowers by local offcials angered by critical media coverage.”</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8211; Passage of a press law. This would be<br />\nconsistent with existing national policy of governance based on rule of law. A<br />\nspecific press law “can help prohibit administrative control and interference<br />\nin the media.”</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8211; Official tolerance and support for press<br />\nfreedom organizations. Such organizations would “defend press freedom and the<br />\nindependence of media from the government and help address a crisis of ethics<br />\nin the profession.”</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8211; Independent public service media. A<br />\n“non-commercial, non-profit, public radio and television system” would help to<br />\n“guarantee the dissemination of education, science, health, and other content<br />\nto feed an information-hungry populace.”</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8211; Better coordination and stakeholder<br />\ncollaboration on the digital switch-over process. There is currently no clear<br />\nprocess for mediating different bureaucratic, economic, commercial, and public<br />\ninterests. The report argues that “there should be the means for collaboration<br />\nbetween industry players, especially broadcasting companies and mobile<br />\noperators. Close collaboration between the principal stakeholders— the<br />\ngovernment, regulators, broadcasters, transmission providers, receiver<br />\nmanufacturers and retailers, and consumer representatives—is essential.”</span></p>\n<p><span>The results of this month’s leadership<br />\ntransition provide little reason to expect that these things will happen in the<br />\nnear or even medium term. In the long run, however, the report’s authors remain<br />\nhopeful. The internet, they write, “cannot change China’s political life in a<br />\ndramatic way. It can, however, enhance the existing social capital, so that<br />\nsocial forces that are operating independently of the state can have a chance<br />\nto grow and prosper.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span> </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=b4fd4ae247\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/mstlf\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
