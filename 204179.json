But I haven’t mentioned the other side of the<br />\nstory. I think <span>weibo</span> [similar to Twitter] plays a<br />\nlarge role in supplying the news. But, at the same time, I’m very doubtful<br />\nabout the extent to which reports of these incidents can truly affect Chinese<br />\npolitics. The leadership’s invoking of minsheng is a response<br />\nto what it’s hearing about popular concerns via channels like Sina weibo,<br />\nbut it’s not a real response. It’s not a systemic response. Even in the case of<br />\nthe train crash, we know some cadres got punished and the victims received a<br />\nlot of money by Chinese government standards, but still the State Council<br />\npromised Chinese netizens it would publish a thorough report on the<br />\naccident, and it hasn’t. So a lot of problems are just addressed at a<br />\nsuperficial level and people are still powerless whenever there are tragedies.<br />\nSo I think it’s only the beginning. The weibo, and the Chinese<br />\nInternet play a very important role, but not a decisive role. I don’t think<br />\nthey will transform Chinese politics. That’s only a fantasy.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span> </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>What<br />\nabout the traditional media in China? Everywhere else in the world tools like<br />\nSina weibo<i> </i>have changed the way journalists work in traditional<br />\nmedia. What does that relationship look like in China?</span></b><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Well<br />\nfirst of all, the Chinese media industry is not a monolith. There are still the<br />\nhardcore media: party newspapers, most of the television stations and radio<br />\nstations, each province’s provincial newspaper. These are all under the tight<br />\ncontrol of the propaganda departments. They comprise the traditional channel<br />\nfor the government to try to push information down to the media. But in the<br />\npast roughly 20 years of the commercialization of the Chinese media there have<br />\narisen quite a number of metropolitan newspapers or dushibao. These<br />\npapers have taken a radical attitude toward the market because they have to<br />\ncompete with other media in terms of advertising revenue, subscriptions, etc.<br />\nThey play to the market. So on a lot of occasions they content does reflect the<br />\ncurrent transformations of Chinese society. By trying to be close to their<br />\nreaders, these papers reflect much more reality than those of the Party media<br />\nsystem.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Then<br />\nwe have new media. The commercial media have a very close relationship with new<br />\nmedia, not only because they are trying to migrate content online, they’re<br />\ntrying to use new distribution channels, creating their own apps. But also<br />\nusually their editors and journalists are highly active in weibo and<br />\nsocial media. Some metropolitan newspapers have even made it a policy that<br />\njournalists and editors must have a weibo account. It’s related to<br />\ntheir job performance. They have to be saying something about the newspaper<br />\nitself or about society in general.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>So<br />\nthose journalists active on weibo gather a lot of information<br />\nfrom the internet. And people who are not working in the media who have<br />\nsomething they want to communicate can easily get direct messages to the<br />\njournalists. A lot of journalists use their real names and post their news<br />\norganizations. So there’s a close relationship between the audience and those<br />\nactive journalists.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span> </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>You’ve<br />\njust spent around four months here in New York. Even given that you’re highly<br />\nconnected to China via the internet, has being away changed anything about how<br />\nyou see the media or society, has it had an effect on your views of things you<br />\npay attention to?</span></b><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>It’s<br />\nbeen very fruitful to be in the U.S. Right after I arrived in New York, the<br />\nOccupy Wall Street movement began. So I went to see the protests and I also<br />\nread a lot of new media reports on this movement. I think I learned useful<br />\nlessons from this. In my work, I’m thinking about the different forms and<br />\ndifferent ways of growing social movements in the Chinese context. So while<br />\nobserving Occupy Wall Street, I was also thinking about how it’s relevant to<br />\nChinese social movements in the Chinese context.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span> </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>And<br />\nhow is it relevant? Because to many observers it might seem the political<br />\nenvironments in the U.S. and China are different enough to make comparisons of<br />\nsocial movements in the two countries very difficult.</span></b><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>In<br />\nChina, it’s very hard for social mobilization and social movements to be led or<br />\norganized by individuals, because the government is very heavy handed. Usually,<br />\nChinese social mobilization is temporary, improvised and does not have any<br />\nsupport from organizations, like those that exist in the U.S., whose main<br />\npurpose is to organize advocacy, protests, etc. But Occupy Wall Street is not a<br />\ntraditional U.S. social movement.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>I<br />\nwas on hand to observe the so-called general assemblies. Everybody could<br />\nparticipate, use the “people’s mike.” They take turns speaking, and it’s<br />\nchaotic. But this leaderless movement is relevant to the Chinese side. As I<br />\nmentioned just now, I think in China if you have a movement that is highly<br />\nconcentrated on personal leadership, it would be crushed very quickly.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>It’s<br />\njust been reported that the leader of the uprising in the village of Wukan in<br />\nGuangdong has been beaten to death, by the police.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>So<br />\nI’m saying that the new kind of social movement, one characteristic is the<br />\nleaderless organization and the other thing I’m keen on observing how they’re<br />\nusing social media like live streaming, the <u><span>WePay</span></u> platform for people to donate,<br />\nand the <u><span>Tumblr</span></u> thing is very emotional and<br />\nvery moving.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span> </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"450\" height=\"309\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=738338\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"738338\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1000,"categories":[9203],"tags":[16912]}
