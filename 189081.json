The show will feature &#8216;ready-made&#8217; Neolithic vessels from 5000 BC revamped in neon paint and corporate logos. According to the gallery, these will be &#8220;shown alongside a short film of Ai Weiwei producing the ‘ready-mades’ and a photographic triptych after which the display is named, showing Ai dropping an urn dating from the Han dynasty.&#8221;</div>\n<div>While fun and accessible, Weiwei&#8217;s pieces are driven by a brave voice of protest and an investigative eye turned toward the meaning of value and where we place it. Weighty matters such as modernization and the global economy are thrown off their untouchable pedestal with Weiwei&#8217;s playful aesthetic and mischevious style. As a major dissenting voice for modern China, Weiwei crafts pieces that are more than just fun to look at, but fun to look at nevertheless.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>消息来源：</div>\n<div><span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/26/ai-weiwei-show-exhibits-2_n_982295.html\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/26/ai-weiwei-show-exhibits-2_n_982295.html</a></span></span></div>\n<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4214948278400391962-3668362298891181642?l=loveaiww.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n</p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":994,"categories":[1],"tags":[9625,9484,28511]}
