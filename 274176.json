Several other newspapers ran<br />\nthe mandatory editorial Tuesday with disclaimers highlighting it did not<br />\nreflect their views. The<span> </span>Beijing<br />\nNews<span> </span>ran it Wednesday, but<br />\nnot in a prominent position.</span></p>\n<p><span>The opposition to<br />\nCommunist Party censorship, which began with protests over the government&#39;s<br />\nwholesale rewriting of<span> </span>Southern<br />\nWeekend&#39;s<span> </span>2013 new year<br />\neditorial, has taken on &#8220;such a big dimension, there will be more cases as<br />\nthere is good support from fellow journalists,&#8221; Hu said. &#8220;It is a<br />\nprotest against censorship.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>If<span> </span>Southern Weekend<span> </span>can come out as normal, without being<br />\nsubjected to the tougher controls by Guangdong provincial authorities that its<br />\njournalists have endured since spring 2012, &#8220;that would be a small,<br />\nlimited victory, ” said David Bandurski, a researcher at the University of Hong<br />\nKong&#39;s China Media Project.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;It would also be<br />\na small victory for China&#39;s media, as it sets a precedent and sends a message<br />\nto officials that they can&#39;t change the rules and insert themselves in the<br />\neditorial process,&#8221; Bandurski said. &#8220;They may be less likely to<br />\nencroach on the space that the media does have, or face the clear risk of<br />\nblowback,&#8221; as in this case of these protests.</span></p>\n<p><span>The widespread support<br />\nfor<span> </span>Southern Weekend<span> </span>represents a significant social<br />\nchange, said Li Datong, a Chinese journalist and former editor of a newspaper<br />\nsupplement closed by authorities.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;This protest has<br />\nhad definite social effect, as the whole society now supports<span> </span>Southern Weekend, even<br />\nactresses pay attention to this. The concept of democracy is spreading,&#8221;<br />\nhe said.</span></p>\n<p><span>Earlier this week, Yao<br />\nChen and Li Bingbing posted support on China&#39;s Twitter equivalent, while<br />\n360buy, one of China&#39;s largest online electronics retailer, posted an<br />\nadvertisement hinting at strong support for the paper.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Censorship is no<br />\nsecret in China, but before people felt &#39;it&#39;s nothing to do with me&#39;,&#8221; Li said.<br />\n&#8220;Now people feel that &#39;it is to do with me, my freedom and my freedom of<br />\nexpression. A change is underway, and that&#39;s the real meaning of this<br />\nincident.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>The power of China&#39;s<br />\nmedia remains small in the face of a powerful propaganda bureaucracy, said Li,<br />\nwho doubted<span> </span>Southern Weekend<span> </span>would be able to publish without prior<br />\ncensorship by the government.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;They won&#39;t leave<br />\nany publication alone,&#8221; he said. But the possible resignation of Dai<br />\nZigeng is &#8220;very important. This incident is over, but there will be more<br />\nincidents in future as people like Dai feel the current system cannot continue<br />\nas it is.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=b4fd4ae247\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/mstlf\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[5908,8339,16912,8923]}
