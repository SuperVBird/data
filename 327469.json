He had led a relief team of monks to Yulshul after a devastating earthquake in April 2010, which state media reported left nearly 2,700 dead and 270 others missing. He had also helped in efforts to protect Tibetan language, culture and religion.</p>\n<p>Another monk, Gyurme Tsultrim, who was taken away from Takna monastery in Nangchen on Nov. 29, has been released from detention but placed under house arrest, sources said.</p>\n<p>Local Tibetans suspect he was detained because of a speech he gave during a prayer festival in Nangchen in which he urged the promotion of Tibetan Buddhism, the Tibetan language, and moral ethics, the sources had said.</p>\n<p>Sporadic demonstrations challenging Beijing’s rule have continued in Tibetan-populated areas of China since widespread protests swept the area in 2008.</p>\n<p>A total of 125 Tibetans have also set themselves ablaze in self-immolation protests calling for Tibetan freedom since February 2009, with another six setting fire to themselves in India and Nepal. </p></div>\n<div>\n<div>（转自自由亚洲：<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/rally-12262013143513.html\">http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/rally-12262013143513.html</a>）</div>\n<div></div>\n<h1><span>In this March, 2011 photo provided by Tibetan writer Tsering Woeser, Karma <span>…</span></span></h1>\n<div><img alt=\"In this March, 2011 photo provided by Tibetan writer Tsering Woeser, Karma Tsewang, left, a highly regarded Tibetan monk, holds a Buddhist script as he offers Buddhist blessings to believers at a preaching center established by Japa Monastery in Nangqian county, Qinghai province, China.
