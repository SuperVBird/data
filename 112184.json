If anything,<br />\ncensorship has only made it hotter—possibly giving Wen additional political<br />\nclout in the process.</span></p>\n<p><span>“The longer the newspapers refuse to report it, the more<br />\nneed there is for us to discuss it vigorously,” one user on Sina Weibo,<br />\nSina.com’s popular Twitter-like micro-blogging service, wrote about the<br />\ninterview.</span></p>\n<p><span>“Sunlight at last!” wrote another on the website of Phoenix<br />\nTV, one of the few online sites that published a Chinese <a href=\"http://news.ifeng.com/mainland/detail_2010_10/05/2704767_0.shtml\">summary</a><br />\nof the interview.</span></p>\n<p><span>The exclusive <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/podcasts/fareedzakaria/site/2010/10/03/gps.podcast.10.03.cnn\">interview</a>,<br />\nWen’s first with a Western journalist since he spoke with Zakaria <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0809/28/fzgps.01.html,%20aired%20Wednesday\">in<br />\n2008</a> on CNN, began spreading through the Chinese Internet almost as soon as<br />\nit was posted online.</span></p>\n<p><span>Already a popular figure among the masses at home, Wen has<br />\nbeen making waves in and outside of China recently by openly discussing<br />\npolitical reform, including on a <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2010/08/25/did-wen-go-off-message\">visit</a><br />\nto Shenzhen in August during which he predicted China’s economic reforms would<br />\neventually fail without reforms to the country’s political system (<a href=\"http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2010-08/22/nw.D110000renmrb_20100822_1-01.htm\">in<br />\nChinese</a>).</span></p>\n<p><span>Speaking through a translator to Zakaria, Wen was calm and<br />\nmeasured throughout the interview, and clearly came prepared on the topic of<br />\nreform, sidestepping a challenge from Zakaria on censorship with a nevertheless<br />\nstrong statement in support of greater freedom.</span></p>\n<p><span>“I believe I and all the Chinese people have such a<br />\nconviction that China will make continuous progress and the people’s wishes for<br />\nand needs for democracy and freedom are irresistible,” Wen said. “I hope that<br />\nyou will be able to gradually see the continuous progress of China.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Later, addressing allegations that he has yet to walk the<br />\nreform he talks about, he says: “I would like to tell you the following two<br />\nsentences to reinforce my case on this or my view on this point, that is, I<br />\nwill not fall in spite of a strong wind and harsh rain and I will not yield<br />\ntill the last day of my life.”</span></p>\n<p><span>There has been skepticism about whether Wen’s <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703882304575465092570633742.html\">comments</a><br />\nin recent months really herald a new reform era. But on China’s Internet, an<br />\noutpouring of support for Wen followed quickly after bilingual Chinese-English <a href=\"http://www.alibuybuy.com/25770.html\">transcripts</a> of the interview<br />\nbegan appearing.</span></p>\n<p><span>“If this is real, and if it’s needed, I’ll give my life,<br />\ntoo,” wrote “Andrianme” on Sina Weibo.</span></p>\n<p><span>“The three great men of the last century: Sun Yat-sen, Mao<br />\nZedong and Deng Xiaoping,” read a post that had earned more than 11,000<br />\n‘recommend’ clicks on the Phoenix TV site as of this writing. “If Premier Wen<br />\ncan really push through political reform, he’ll be the first great man of the<br />\nnew century.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Information about the interview on the Chinese Internet<br />\nappears to come almost exclusively from Phoenix TV, blogs and micro-blogging<br />\nservices like Sina Weibo. News portals in China are running a <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2010-10/06/c_12632809_2.htm\">commentary</a><br />\non the interview from the official Liberation Daily newspaper that manages not to<br />\nquote Wen at all, focusing instead on the differences in Zakaria’s questions<br />\nfrom 2008 and 2010.</span></p>\n<p><span>The irony of Wen’s statements on freedom and censorship<br />\nbeing censored in official media was not lost on Chinese observers.</span></p>\n<p><span>“A lot of Chinese people don’t know their premier has been<br />\nharmonized,” prominent Beijing University Internet researcher Hu Yong wrote on<br />\nTwitter, using the Chinese euphemism for censorship. “Wen Jiabao’s comments<br />\nabout political reform being censored at least tells us one thing: In front of<br />\nthe big wall, everyone is equal.” </span></p>\n<p><span>Others, like ‘Idle Notes,’ responded to the news blockage<br />\nwith anger: “The entire world gets to hear our premier speak and our own media<br />\ndoesn’t report it? Whatever you refuse to report, I’ll just post. [Expletive] you<br />\npropagandists for the Imperial Court!”</span></p>\n<p><span>While the vast majority of the commentary on Wen’s<br />\ninterview—or what little of it people in China saw—was adulatory, some remained<br />\nskeptical of the premier’s ability to make good on his rhetoric.</span></p>\n<p><span>“Let’s not be too naïve here. Who stands to lose the most<br />\nfrom political reform?” Sina user ‘Big Uncle 98’ wrote in thinly veiled<br />\nreference to leaders in Beijing. “Do you think they’ll dig their own graves?…<br />\nDo you think they’re not afraid they’ll eventually be held to account?”</span></p>\n<p><span>A post by ‘Own Worst Enemy,’ one of the most popular on<br />\nSina Weibo, may have put it best: “It’s not easy being Premier.”</span></p>\n<p><em>– Josh<br />\nChin.
