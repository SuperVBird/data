Some media organizations had been<br />\ntransformed from Communist Party propaganda tools into market-oriented news<br />\noutlets. The Party line had weakened while market influences strengthened,<br />\nleaving many journalists with an expectation of a new wave of semi-independent<br />\njournalism.</span><span></p>\n<p><span>There had just been a change of leadership, with<br />\nHu Jintao taking over as president. In response to the SARS pandemic, the<br />\ncentral government launched new laws and new accountability systems, igniting<br />\nhopes for responsible and transparent governance. Market-oriented news outlets<br />\nlike the weekly magazine Caijing and the daily newspaper Southern Metropolis<br />\nNews expanded coverage.</span><br /></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>In April of 2003, Southern Metropolis<br />\nNews published a story about Sun Zhigang, 27, a graphic designer who was picked<br />\nup by police during a random identity check and died in custody, after being<br />\nattacked by staff and inmates. The story caused a national outcry, the first<br />\nmass protest in China’s budding online space. The detention and repatriation<br />\nregulation, under which Sun had been held, was abolished, and a decade of<br />\nrights advocacy began. The market-oriented media and new private online<br />\nventures opened up an alternative space where people could express their<br />\nopinions outside official discourse.</span><span></p>\n<p><span>Ten years later, with Xi Jinping now president,<br />\nthose advances are being reversed. In December, Chinese authorities charged<br />\nfree speech activists who protested outside the Southern Media Group’s offices<br />\nwith public order offenses. The media group—which owns Southern Weekly, one of<br />\nthe most liberal newspapers in China—has been criticized for allegedly<br />\nproviding evidence to the police that the protests were interfering with their<br />\noperations. The claim, which many believe is false, seems designed to tarnish<br />\nthe paper’s moral image.</span></p>\n<p><span>The press is under political as well as economic<br />\npressure. The experience of Chen Yongzhou is a case in point. A respected<br />\njournalist working for Guangdong’s New Express, Chen was arrested in October<br />\nafter he had reported alleged corruption at a state-owned construction<br />\nequipment company. As the New Express and other media outlets were showing<br />\nsolidarity with Chen, he confessed on TV that he had been bribed to report<br />\nfalse information. Though some feared Chen had been tortured into making a<br />\nconfession, he and the New Express went from being victims to being loathed<br />\nacross China. </span></p>\n<p><span>For market-oriented media, cost cutting and<br />\ndeclining advertising revenues have contributed to a lack of newsroom<br />\nprotection and a drop in professionalism and ethical standards. Economic<br />\ninterests are pushing aside the public interest. Now, just as a decade ago,<br />\nmarket-oriented media face a turning point, this time for the worse. </span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span> </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Communist Party outlets will continue to<br />\nreceive financial support from the Party itself. Private online media are<br />\nboldly exploring new applications, new platforms, and new services to meet the<br />\nneeds of a new generation of consumers. But the space market-oriented media<br />\nhave traditionally occupied is being squeezed by government censorship on the<br />\none hand and declining economic viability on the other. The golden age is over.<br />\nThe next decade, if there is one, will be precarious.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span><br /></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span></p>\n<p></span><span></span></p>\n<p><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/article/103054/Under-Pressure.aspx\">http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/article/103054/Under-Pressure.aspx</a></span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=2ea93c5b7b\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/msuvD\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
