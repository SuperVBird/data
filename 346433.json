It was announced on 7 May that Mr YIU was convicted to a prison term of 10 years in the name of &ldquo;smuggling&rdquo;.  And jouranlist GAO Yu was taken into custody on 7 May in the name of &ldquo;disclosure of state secrets&#8221; in Peking.  The latest development<br />\nindicates that the evil claw of the Chinese authorities is expanding its reach to the Special Administrative Regions, tightening the grip on freedom of speech.  To express our strong opposition, with immediate effect, the undersigned shall suspend all communication activities (namely, seminars, visits, a chat, a coffee and a meal) with:</p>\n<p>1. &ldquo;researchers&rdquo; from Chinese governmental or semi-governmental institutions, in particular those without academic publications; and </p>\n<p>2. soi-disant &ldquo;journalists&rdquo; who fail to prove their active role in a traditional / new media outlet, until the a continuous improvement of freedom of speech in China is seen. </p>\n<p>Macau, 14 May 2014</p>\n<p>Jason CHAO Teng Hei (the initiator), Roy CHOI Chi Chio</p>\n<p>Background information:</p>\n<p>Pro-democracy activists and legislators are often approached by &ldquo;researchers&rdquo; from Chinese governmental or semi-governmental institutions or &ldquo;sociological department&rdquo; of an &ldquo;academic institution,&rdquo; or soi-disant &ldquo;journalists&rdquo; who do not work for real publishers, for interviews on the latest development, plans, and organisation of activism.  A principle devised by Antonio NG Kuok Cheong is generally  observed that those &ldquo;interviewers&rdquo; are treated as real journalists in a way which information which has already been made public or may be made public shall be discussed.  (Legislator NG said he personally supported the action of the declarants but would not take part in this action.)</p>\n</p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=2ea93c5b7b\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/msuvD\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":997,"categories":[18270,18269,20534],"tags":[19196,8712]}
