In July 2009, after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/05/xianjiang-riots-security-uighur-han\">riots in Xinjiang</a>, the micro-blogging service was blocked. Now, it can only be accessed via proxy server inside China. </p>\n<p>  The Chinese Twitter community is relatively small. Renown artist and activist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_Weiwei\">Ai Wei Wei</a> only has 44,621 followers &#8211; where American celebrity Twitters will attract millions.   However,the community&#8217;s influence extends well beyond its size: Stories will crop up on Twitter and filter down to Chinese blogs within the firewall. This phenomenon hasn&#8217;t gone unnoticed by authorities &#8211; several Tweeters on this list have undergone police questioning related to their Twitter activity. </p>\n<p> From the political to the pornographic &#8211; here are the people making the biggest waves in China Tweetsville.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"> <strong>CHINA&#8217;S TOP TWEETERS</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/aiww\"><img src=\"http://www.urbanatomy.com/images/stories/Article-image201008/aiweiwei.jpg\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" height=\"223\" width=\"131\" />@aiww </a></p>\n<p><strong>Followers:</strong> 44,621 </p>\n</p>\n<div>A</div>\n<p>i Wei Wei  designed the Beijing National Stadium (the Bird&#8217;s Nest) for the 2008 Winter Olympics.

In the past two years, he has been involved in investigating the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_schools_corruption_scandal\">student deaths during the Sichuan earthquake</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2009 he was beaten by police in Sichuan to prevent him testifying for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tan_Zuoren\">Tan Zuoren</a>, another activist who was sentenced to five years in prison. Ai Wei Wei<a href=\"http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Ai-Weiwei-publishes-images-of-himself-in-hospital-on-Twitter/19331\"> tweeted a photo of himself hospitalized</a>.  </p>\n<p>Ai Wei Wei enlisted the help of his Twitter followers for a memorial to earthquake victims &#8211; he asked people to record themselves saying the name of of one of the victims. When someone sent him a recording, he took the name off the list.
