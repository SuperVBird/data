At least, that’s what fans have<br />\nbeen telling her, lately. While she was promoting her 2012 book,<span> </span><i><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://consentofthenetworked.com/\"><span>Consent of the Networked</span></a></i>, she spent a good<br />\nbit of time talking about surveillance not only in authoritarian countries but<br />\nalso in democracies, and when Snowden’s leaks rustled up public interest in<br />\nthat very topic, “It was like, ‘Hello, I’ve been talking about this!’” she<br />\nsays. “Finally someone is paying attention to these issues.”</span></p>\n<p><span>In<span> </span><i>Consent of the Networked</i>,<br />\nMacKinnon wrote about democracy in the digital age—how the decisions of big<br />\nInternet companies and governments were changing civil rights around the world,<br />\nand not always in ways that should sit well citizens of democratic societies.<br />\nDecisions like, say, handing over the information companies collect about their<br />\nusers to the National Security Agency.</span></p>\n<p><span>“There’s a pretty big<br />\nblack box, as the Snowden revelations have shown, around the relationships<br />\nbetween companies and government,” she says. “What these companies are doing<br />\nwith this information—they’re not being sufficiently transparent about what<br />\nthey’re doing with it.”</span></p>\n<p><span>With her new project,<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rankingdigitalrights.org/\"><span>Ranking Digital Rights</span></a>, MacKinnon aims to<br />\nclear away some of that opacity. The project will assess and rank Internet and<br />\ntelecommunications companies on their policies, practices, and transparency<br />\naround human rights, free expression, and privacy. Some Internet companies<br />\nalready participate in<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cjr.org/cloud_control/brazilian_takedown_requests.php\"><span>voluntary assessments</span></a><span> </span>of their work on these issue. But<br />\nMacKinnon wants to expand accountability to a bigger group of companies.<br />\nFunding permitting, the project will rank 50 to 100 companies.</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s a mammoth task:<br />\nAfter months of work, the project’s first product, a draft of the criteria that<br />\nit might use to evaluate companies, came out in early July. Researchers are now<br />\nstarting on case studies; the goal is to develop the final draft of the ranking<br />\ncriteria by the end of this year, complete the methodology, and start assessing<br />\ncompanies in the next, releasing the first report later in 2014. But with this<br />\nproject, she could use the platform and reputation she’s built around issues of<br />\nInternet freedom to help make sure she can say “I told you so” about the<br />\npossibilities of digital rights, instead of the pitfalls of letting them slip<br />\naway.</span></p>\n<p><span>MacKinnon began<br />\nthinking about this project as she was promoting her book and trying to figure<br />\nout what would come next for her. In<span> </span><i>Consent<br />\nof the Networked</i>, she had laid out a number of actions—including developing<br />\na more vibrant Internet freedom movement—and plenty of people had asked her if<br />\nshe was planning on doing anything concrete to make them happen. “Do I write<br />\nanother book?” she thought. “Or do I actually try to push in practice some of<br />\nthe things I was calling for?”</span></p>\n<p><span>That can be an<br />\nangst-provoking question for a journalist. MacKinnon started her career in<br />\nBeijing, working her way up in the CNN bureau to become a correspondent. Ten<br />\nyears ago, after a stint in the network’s Tokyo bureau, she left Asia to become<br />\na fellow at Harvard,<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shorensteincenter.org/fellowships/former-fellows-by-semester/spring-2004/\"><span>looking at</span></a><span> </span>“whether new technology and new media<br />\ncan be used to create better journalism.” Since then, she’s lived<br />\nprofessionally in the world of university fellowships, first researching<br />\nInternet censorship in China, then collecting material for her book. She’s far<br />\nenough away from the media’s mainstream that not everyone’s sure what to call<br />\nher anymore. </span></p>\n<p><span>“I tend to be<br />\ndescribed as a journalist/advocate,” she says. “We’re at a point in history<br />\nthat whether the Internet is going to evolve in a way that’s compatible with<br />\ndemocracy and human rights is really kind of up in the air. However you want to<br />\npigeonhole me, with whatever label, I’d like to make a contribution to it going<br />\nin the right direction. Call me what you want.”</span></p>\n<p><span>But she does have a strong view of where her<br />\nstrengths lie. She wasn’t, for instance, going to be the one to implement her<br />\nown suggestion that citizens of the Internet from across the world band<br />\ntogether to demand civil rights. “I’m not a rabble-rousing movement leader,”<br />\nshe says. A fact-based research project that would increase accountability and<br />\ntransparency of powerful companies seemed like a better way to expand on the<br />\nideas she had developed.</span></p>\n<p><span>To create criteria on<br />\nwhich to rank these companies, MacKinnon has been drawing on the<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf\"><span>United Nation’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human<br />\nRights</span></a><span> </span>and consulting<br />\nwith human rights groups, academics, technologists, and socially responsible<br />\ninvestors. The ranking system she comes up with needs to be meaningful to<br />\nstakeholders like these and to reflect what’s reasonable to expect from<br />\ncompanies and how they deal with the demands of governments across the world.</span></p>\n<p><span>“Most companies would<br />\nrather not be graded at all,” she says. “If you start talking to them too<br />\nearly, they’ll say, ‘Oh, please don’t do it. We’d rather you went and wrote<br />\nanother book.’ Or, ‘We’d rather you’d rank governments—they’re much worse.’”</span></p>\n<p><span>That’s part of the<br />\nreason it took as long as it did to release the first set of draft criteria:<br />\nThis one is coherent enough, MacKinnon says, to share with the world—and with<br />\nthe companies who will serve as the project’s case studies, to test out and<br />\npolish the questions that will be used to create the actual rankings. She’s not<br />\nready to say exactly which companies will be included in the first big report<br />\nyet—there’s a draft list that keeps changing, but “if you’re thinking of the<br />\nmost powerful Internet companies that are used by the greatest number of<br />\npeople, you can guess the obvious ones,” she says. She and her collaborators<br />\nare also looking at including newer companies, less obvious ones, cloud<br />\ncomputing leaders, widely used domain hosts, and companies that are household<br />\nnames in other countries, but not in the US.</span></p>\n<p><span>At the same time, her<br />\nstrategy for keeping herself accountable is to keep talking to everyone who has<br />\na stake in the project’s outcome and to make the ranking project itself as<br />\ntransparent as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span>“I was advised early<br />\non that we should put as much in the public as early as possible and not being<br />\nall secretive about what we’re working on,” she says. “The companies are not<br />\ngoing to be able to say they didn’t know it was coming.”</span></p>\n<p><span><i><span>Disclosure: CJR has<br />\nreceived funding from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) to cover<br />\nintellectual-property issues, but the organization has no influence on the<br />\ncontent.</span></i><span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span><span>Sarah<br />\nLaskow</span><span> is a writer and editor in New York City.
