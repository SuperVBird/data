The announcement of his candidacy on Tuesday drew scant attention from the state-backed media. In one of the few detailed stories to appear recently on his bid, the China Business News said last week, “Jon Huntsman’s prospects are not quite clear. He is not widely known by the American public except for the elite circle in Washington D.C. and the state of Utah. His campaign strategy is moderate, which will not help him to gain enough trust within the Republican Party.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>        <span>在中国，洪博培的新事业远不及他上一个来的那么让人兴奋。其周三发表的参选总统声明，并没有引起多少官方媒体的关注。</span><span>上周，</span><span>在近来一篇</span><span>少有</span><span>详述</span><span>洪博培未来谋划的文章中</span><span>，</span><span>第一财经日报称，“</span><span>洪博培的前景尚不明朗。除了华盛顿精英圈及犹他州，他并不为美国公众所熟知。他的竞选策略温和，也难以助其在共和党内获得足够的信任。</span><span>”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s a long way from the cheerful reception that Huntsman received as an arriving U.S. Ambassador less than two years ago. Fluent Mandarin and an adopted Chinese daughter made him a media favorite. But by the time he left in April, having cut short his job in order to run for President, he had baffled the Chinese establishment and allowed himself to be swept—wittingly or otherwise—into Communist Party conspiracy theories about Western intentions to spread democracy. His appearance at a rally inspired by unrest in the Middle East—which Ryan Lizza rightly enshrined as “The Huntsman Walk”—was widely perceived among Chinese counterparts as a provocation, despite his adamant denials. In his farewell speech, Huntsman said, “the United States will never stop supporting human rights because we believe in the fundamental struggle for human dignity and justice wherever it may occur.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>       这与两年前<span>洪博培出任新美国驻华大使时，所受到的盛情款待相比，简直是天壤之别。流利的汉语外加收养的中国女儿，让他成为媒体最爱。不过，4月，在他为竞选总统而辞职离任时，</span><span>洪博培的所作所为</span><span>不仅让中国权贵们大惑不解，也使他自己有意无意地同共产党有关西方意图输出民主的阴谋论扯上了关系。他在一次</span><span><span>受中东动乱而引发的集</span></span><span>会上的出现——</span><span>瑞安-利扎称之为“</span><span>洪博培散步”，被大多数中国政客中认为是一种挑衅。尽管予以了坚决否认，但在告别演说中，</span><span>洪博培说到，“美国不会停止对于人权的支持，因为我们相信，无论在何处，争取人的尊严和正义是最根本的。”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>The Huntsman campaign has hardly moved to patch up relations; on the contrary, it has seemed inclined to want to tease out the attractive bits of his foreign experience from the less convenient facts that he was doing anything at the behest of a Democrat. Just one day before announcing his candidacy, his campaign’s Facebook account posted a photo of the candidate with the Dalai Lama, which A.F.P. identified as a ten-year-old photo from his time as governor of Utah. By contrast, his twenty-month stint in Beijing yielded just two photos of him, each on a bicycle in a section entitled “On Two Wheels,” reserved mostly for his affection for the motorized variety. The choice of photos did not go unnoticed here, and attracted a story in the Global Times today, (h/t Wall Street Journal.) though it has not attracted much public clucking.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span>       洪博培在竞选活动中也几乎无意修补双方的关系。有些弄巧成拙的是，此行此举</span><span>似乎</span><span>更容易让人从他短暂而又傲人的国外经历中得出这样一个不太合适的事实——他可以为了民主党人的任命做任何事。就在宣布参选前一天，</span><span>洪博培</span><span>的竞选脸谱帐号上贴出了一张他与达赖喇嘛的合影。经过法新社的辨认，这是10年前他身为犹他州州长时所拍的。相形之下，</span><span>洪博培</span><span>20个月的北京经历却只有两张名为“两轮之上”的照片，拍得都是他在路上骑车，这多半还是出于他对各种机械的喜爱。照片的选取并没有引起多少人的注意，除了</span><span>今天</span><span>环球时报的一篇文章外。不过就算这也没有引来多少公众的关心。</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Why is Huntsman so cool on China? The Chinese press has a theory, according to the China Business News: “His experience as the U.S. Ambassador to China is a double-edged sword. None of his rivals will neglect the fact that the profits of his family business in China has increased up to fifty-seven per cent during his term.” (A piece on that subject last week has been widely mentioned in the Chinese press.)</p></blockquote>\n<p>       为什么<span>洪博培会如此冷遇中国？中国新闻界有这样一种说法。第一财经日报称：</span><span>“他</span><span>出任美国驻华大使的经历是一把双刃剑。没有哪个竞选对手会忽视这样一个事实，</span><span>在洪博培的任期内，</span><span>其家族企业在华利润增长了57%。”（这一小点在上周的中国媒体上被普遍提及。)</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>That might be a reason—and the tangle of family and business resonates widely in China—but the press in a one-party state can be forgiven for failing to grasp just how much more urgent it is for a Republican candidate to hasten to distance himself from the assignment he so recently relished at the pleasure of a Democratic President.</p></blockquote>\n<p>        这或许是个理由，<span>毕竟洪博培</span>家族和商业间纷繁复杂的关系在中国有着广泛的共鸣。不过，一个一党专政国家的媒体领会不出其中的奥妙，也是情有可原的。要知道，对于一个共和党候选人来说，赶紧与这份欣然接受自一位民主党总统的职务撇开距离，才是最为关键的。</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://article.yeeyan.org/view/222871/202365#newComment\">添加新评论</a></p>\n<p><strong>相关文章：</strong></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"http://article.yeeyan.org/view/229287/202225?from=rss_related\">不要高估中国威胁</a></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"http://article.yeeyan.org/view/228841/202384?from=rss_related\">中国首艘航母将于下星期进行海上试航</a></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"http://article.yeeyan.org/view/222871/202140?from=rss_related\">中国：旱情之后是洪灾</a></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"http://article.yeeyan.org/view/200891/202019?from=rss_related\">Facebook增势减缓，欲挑战中国迷局？</a></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"http://article.yeeyan.org/view/228841/202157?from=rss_related\">当中国的奢侈品泡沫破灭</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www1.feedsky.com/t1/526251434/yeeyan/feedsky/s.gif?r=http://article.yeeyan.org/view/222871/202365\" border=\"0\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":176,"categories":[20534],"tags":[]}
