Melamine levels in twenty-two milk brands far exceeded the national standard, for a while people rejecting domestic milk products became a widespread trend. In view of this, Niu Gensheng, the CEO of Mengniu, a major company which milk products contained excessive levels of Melamine, used the same method Liu Bei had employed to win the hearts and minds of the people – he shed tears, and in his own defense he stressed his company&#8217;s status as a national brand, as a means of gaining consumers&#8217; sympathy, thereby making people forget that they did not change fundamentally; [questions like] how to monitor product quality, by whom; how to disclose information without falsification; how to prevent deceptive advertising, and so on [all tossed to the wind]. With these means used Niu and others got an early &#8220;Acquittal&#8221; and could continue making lots of money unscrupulously; they did so in exactly the same way as the government got away with it by mixing up the party and the state (by treating the party&#8217;s private interests as though it were national interests); and blurring the line between the government and the country (by labeling criticism of the government as &#8220;anti-China&#8221;, so as to stir up anger in &#8220;people who have no knowledge of the truth&#8221;). These people didn&#8217;t just get away with it – they didn&#8217;t forget to pocket huge amount of money as they dodged punishment.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p>The issue of milk with excessive levels of melamine is not yet over, many families with children having developed kidney stones are suffering great pain. And now Mengniu has again started getting us to know something new in food chemistry. Excessive levels of OMP have been found in Mengniu milk deluxe (Mr Fang Zhouzi had proved this material to be of the same bio-chemical structure as IGF-1), [this] will jeopardize people&#8217; health and lead to an increased risk of contracting many types of cancer. According to a report from the China Economic Net, &#8220;Mr Fang wrote that there was also IGF-1 in other milk [brands], but was at a low level, its concentration was roughly at about 4ng/ml, ultrahigh temperature sterilization could not render it completely inactive. However, according to Mengniu&#8217;s patented formula, the levels of of IGF-1 per 100g of Mengniu milk deluxe was as high as 5.65~16.8mg100g, making its IGF-1 levels tens of thousands fold higher than other milk brands. If that was true, then the consumers should worry about the increased risk of contracting many types of cancer. However, in a self-defense response, Mengniu claimed OMP to be different from IGF-1, and not only that, they stated they had got approval from some kind of authority, which credibility begged consumers’ questions. Because the integrity of Chinese companies like Mengniu have been under big tests; and because of what these companies had done in the past, we have to be on high guard and vigilant against their bragging.</p>\n<p>A government and a political party that is so corrupt that people find it hard to like them; an enterprise that is so evil that it harms people; yet they both tend to employ patriotism tricks and national identity to dishonestly earn people&#8217;s trust, a trick that have long been in use by our party state which is inundated with &#8216;patriotic sentiment&#8217;, as well as enterprises. Laughably, such fooling tricks, which can be easily seen through by those with discerning eyes, actually have quite a few people who buy them. These people certainly include beneficiaries—fifty-centers hired by the authorities; concerned parties bribed with money by enterprises —who sway public opinions, formulate a false public will which they then use to launch a masses campaign to numb the general public who have been fooled and fooled due to information asymmetry. In so doing [the beneficiaries] accomplish the purpose of re-exploiting the general public. This way of using patriotism to form an illusion of masses unity, making consumers feel there are safety in numbers when they follow the crowd, and result in their purchasing low quality goods. Such is the masses psychological basis of &#8220;buying patriotic flat”, “drinking patriotic milk&#8221;. There are people who at times have put too much faith in the notion of safety in numbers, believing that if the number of people deceived increase, their bargaining and negotiation power would too increase. Sadly, this is only wishful thinking. [It makes no difference] however large the group you are in, if you are not allowed to defend your rights in groups or by forming organization; if you cannot receive judicial assistance; or if the courts dismiss your cases; you are just as small, isolated and helpless. And the enterprises would bribe related government departments with money, reducing you to a lone atom that have no ability to fight back, leaving you with no choice but to unilaterally accept their compensation which you are not happy with. This approach seems to work well every time, so do not believe the illusion easily that they will not deceive groups. They break down groups by effective use of power and money, and ultimately it is you that get hurt. In view of this, the biggest advantage you have when facing bad enterprises is to [boycott them].</p>\n<p>Put it this way, if you really love your country, if you really hope Chinese enterprises to [survive] market risks, what you should do most is to be strict with them, to exhaust every means permitted by the laws to make them improve; this is the way that can really save you as well as them. Only in this way is it possible to achieve a win-win situation that is probable. And this way is also applicable to our government, if you really love China, you should not let the government ruin it. Be strict with the government; supervise it in multi-channels until government rivals emerge, thereby forming a check-and-balance system on the government. Only this can bring about a win-win situation between the government and the people; and only this can be called patriotic. Be docile and obedient to an evil government; accommodate in every possible way to bad enterprises; you will end up committing slow suicide because of loving your country this way. By the time you feel your life is really in harm’s way, it will be too late to criticize and fight back. Loving your country in improper ways is effectively harming yourself. Just like we should not love a rope that tightens our throat, we should not love an evil government, or bad enterprises. It is okay to be patriotic, but we should not be patriotic to the point of committing suicide; otherwise, it should indeed be described as &#8220;loving your country to the point of going wacky&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Written at 9:08 am on February 12, 2009 in Chengdu</p>\n<p>附上原文：</p>\n<p>自从三鹿毒奶事件曝光后，得知中国有数十万结石宝宝，稍有良知的中国民众无不义愤填膺。二十二家牛奶品牌三聚氰胺严重超标，一时人们拒绝消费国产牛奶，已呈蔓延之势。于是超标大户蒙牛牛奶的掌门人牛根生，便使出刘备用痛哭而捞得江山的招数，用民族品牌的眼泪作抵押和诉求手段，来赚取消费者的同情，从而让人们忘记他们并无根本上之改变——质量如何监督、谁监督、信息怎么公开而不做假、如何不登虚假广告等——以便提前获得“无罪释放”，赚取大把的昧心钱。而他们赚昧心钱的方式，和政府混淆党国关系（把一党私利混淆为国家大义）、政府与国家的关系的方式（把别人批评政府的混乱无能说成是“反华”，以引起“不明真相的群众”的愤怒）如出一辙，最终就是对自己的为恶金蝉脱壳，不仅金蝉脱壳，而脱壳之时，还不忘捞取大批的不义之财。</p>\n<p>牛奶中超标的三聚氰胺事件了犹未了，许多结石宝宝家庭正在遭受着巨大的痛苦，最近蒙牛又开始给我们普及新的食品化学知识。蒙牛特仑苏牛奶OMP（方舟子论证此与IGF-1生化数据同）物质超标，将危及人的生命安全，会导致多种癌症风险的增加。中国经济网的报道中说，“方舟子写到，一般牛奶也含IGF-1，超高温消毒不能使其完全失活，不过含量很低，浓度约为4ng/ml。但据蒙牛专利，100克特仑苏奶中添加的IGF-1含量高达5.65~16.8mg，为一般牛奶的数万倍。果真如此，就很值得消费者担忧了：患多种癌症的风险会增加。”但蒙牛回应的时候自辩OMP与IGF-1不同，不特如此，他们还认为得到了权威机构的认可，至于这权威机构的可信度有多高，恐怕消费者就应该打个问号了。因为像蒙牛这样的中国企业，其诚信度正经受着巨大的考验。因为他们此前的行为，在没有真正监督的情形下，使我们对他们的自我吹嘘的行为抱有极大的戒心与警惕。</p>\n<p>一个政府与党烂到不可爱，一个企业坏到坑人害人，却常用爱国的招数、民族的招牌，来骗取民众的信任与情感，这是我们这“爱国”泛滥的党国与企业的一贯招数。可笑的是，这种明眼人一看就是愚民的招数，却有不少的应和者。这些应和者中，当然不排除这些利益获取者的舆论引导——官方用五毛，企业用金钱在各方面买通——从而造成一种虚假的民意。然后用这种虚假的爱国民意来达成舆论上的群体攻势，从而麻痹因信息不对称而倍受愚弄的民众，达成在这些民众身上再度盘剥之目的。这种用爱国来形成一种虚胖的群体团结假象，让消费者在随大流中产生一种群体安全感，从而达成对劣质商品的购买，这便是“购爱国房”、“吃爱国奶”的群众心理基础。有一些民众，有时难免太过相信人多势众，相信受骗者人数的增加即可增加谈判议价能力，事实上这只是一个良好的愿望。你人再多，不让你进行群体维权，不让你成立组织来维权，不让你接受司法援助，法院不受理，你都处于一种孤立无援的原子状态。而企业方拿钱买通相关政府部门，把你进一步切割成无反抗力的原子状态，只有单方面接受他们给你并不满意的赔偿。他们这样的做法似乎屡试不爽，所以不要轻易相信他们不会骗群体这种幻觉。他们用权力与金钱对群体切割十分有效，最终受到伤害的就是你自己。因此对不良企业，你最大优势就是用脚投票。</p>\n<p>事实上，你如果真正爱国，如果真正希望中国的企业在市场风险中充满竞争力，你最应该做的就是对它要求严格，用尽一切合法的方式去促使它进步，那么这才是真正拯救你，同时也拯救它的方式。只有这样，才能达成一种可以预期的双赢。而这样的方式也同样适用于对待我们的政府，你真正爱中国，就是不让政府把中国搞坏。对政府严格要求，多方监督，直至促使政府竞争者诞生，从而形成制度上对政府的制衡，这样才会形成政府与民众的多赢，如此方可称为叫爱国。对有害的政府百依百顺，对不良企业百般迁就，最终你会因为这样的爱国而慢性自杀，等你感到生命受到切实伤害的时候，那时再来批评与反抗，就为时已晚了。不恰当的爱国方式，实足以自害。就像我们没有不应该爱一根勒紧自己喉咙的绳索一样，我们不应该爱有害之政府、不良之企业。我们可以爱国，但我们不应该爱国爱到自杀的地步，否则这样的爱国，真可谓爱国爱到你变态。</p>\n<p>延伸阅读<br />一：蒙牛特仑苏添OMP物质被质检总局叫停。http://news.163.com/09/0211/08/51RV5HMO0001124J.html。<br />二：蒙牛关于OMP牛奶的回应。http://finance.sina.com.cn/consume/puguangtai/20090211/16225843874.shtml。</p>\n<p>2009年2月12日9：08分于成都</p>\n<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4214948278400391962-2787502278098225455?l=loveaiww.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/loveAiWeiwei/~4/vjRyfe4cHNo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":656,"categories":[1],"tags":[8905,9001,12643,8904]}
