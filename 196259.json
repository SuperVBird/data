If the nation announces you have a tax problem, you have a tax problem,’” Ai recalls. If the artist fails to pay the money, he’s received threats that his wife and associates will end up in jail. “And they know I would never let that happen. So the game is, they know me.”</p>\n<p>“They follow you around until you have no energy and break down. It’s very successful. It’s a hundred departments, you can’t fight them,” he says. “You should commit suicide before you have to go through this &#8230; the tax bureau and the court and the police are the same person with different faces.
