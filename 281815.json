After authorities had apparently sought to prevent its publishing,<br />\nthe contents were released online.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>Issues faced by media</span></b><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Mr. Wang, one of the authors and a bold<br />\njournalist who has exposed numerous scandals, in a recent interview with The<br />\nHindu, described the increasing difficulties faced by media outlets in<br />\nChina and the need for reforms.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“In the past dozen years, this [2012] is<br />\nthe coldest year for investigative journalism in China,” he told The Hindu,<br />\nspeaking in his modest office in northwest Beijing.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Mr. Wang receives hundreds of letters every<br />\nweek — from aggrieved citizens; from petitioners harassed by their local<br />\ngovernments; and from dispossessed farmers having no recourse to justice. He<br />\nsaid it had become harder for journalists to report on sensitive issues last<br />\nyear, which saw the party embark on a once-in-a-decade leadership change.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“I feel embarrassed and helpless at the<br />\nletters,” Mr. Wang said. “But we should work hard to change the situation. If<br />\nwe don’t work hard, we can’t change the situation and we don’t even have the<br />\npossibility to change the situation.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>Political reforms</span></b><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The authors of the call for reforms hope<br />\nthat the new leadership will push political reforms — starting with taking<br />\nforward long-discussed measures to curtail the party’s power by elevating the<br />\nauthority of the Constitution and the courts — as they assume full control<br />\nfollowing the NPC, which will see outgoing President Mr. Hu; Premier Wen<br />\nJiabao; and other top leaders step down from all their positions.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Titled ‘A Citizen Proposition’ and<br />\naddressed to the NPC’s Standing Committee, the letter argues that ratifying the<br />\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights would better enshrine the<br />\nhuman rights guaranteed under the 1954 Constitution.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“While [China] afterwards suffered many<br />\nturns and setbacks, and paid a steep price on the issues of constitutionalism<br />\nand human rights protection, the great goal of [establishing] human rights has<br />\nalready become a core agenda inseparable from the project of [national]<br />\ntransition in which we are presently engaged,” the letter said. Doing so, it<br />\nadded, would also “demonstrate China’s commitment to be a responsible world<br />\npower”.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Countering recent arguments from<br />\nconservative voices in the party who have blamed “hostile foreign forces” for<br />\nusing the human rights issue as a way to destabilise the country, the letter<br />\nsaid: “China’s government played an important role in the formulation of the<br />\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. International human rights standards are<br />\ntherefore not imported products but in fact include the achievements of Chinese<br />\nculture and the Chinese people.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>Rule of law</span></b><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The letter also highlighted China’s<br />\nprogress in building a society governed by the rule of law, particularly in the<br />\nthree decades since the economic reform and opening up.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“The expansion of civil rights and the<br />\nelevation of the political status of citizens has also, objectively speaking,<br />\ncreated favourable conditions for the ratification of the International<br />\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights,” it argued, saying it would be a<br />\nconstructive step toward renewing. . . safeguarding the life and authority of<br />\nthe Constitution.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The authors also quoted a recent speech by<br />\nnew leader Mr. Xi marking the current Constitution’s 30th anniversary, in which<br />\nhe said “the authority of the Constitution is in its actualisation”.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>“For citizens and the government”, it<br />\nconcluded, “for our nation and peoples, the establishment of a nation of human<br />\nrights, of a China in which Constitutionalism is in force, this is the only<br />\ntrue and fundamental measure of the gloriousness of our achievements and of our<br />\ndreams. If, owing to time considerations, this task cannot be completed this<br />\nyear, we ask that you please be open and considerate, offering the people of<br />\nour country an explanation and at the same time providing an explicit timetable<br />\nso that they understand and trust in their government’s good faith.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span> </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=2ea93c5b7b\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/msuvD\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[10297,5908,16912,8923]}
