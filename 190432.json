After being placed under house arrest, Chen was sentenced in 2006 to four years in prison.</p>\n<p>Chen, who is blind, was released from prison having completed his full sentence in September 2010. No further restrictions on his movement were imposed by the courts and according to Chinese law Chen should now be free. However after returning to Donshigu he and his family have faced a catalog of intimidation and harassment and been held prisoners in their own home.

No further restrictions on his movement were imposed by the courts and according to Chinese law Chen should now be free. However after returning to Donshigu he and his family have faced a catalog of intimidation and harassment and been held prisoners in their own home.</p>\n<p>During the past 12 months neither Chen Guangcheng nor Yuan Weijing have been allowed to leave their house even to shop for groceries or visit the doctor. Their internet connection and phone lines have been disconnected and intrusive surveillance cameras have been installed outside their home. Security personnel monitoring the family have prevented friends and family from visiting. Several raids have been carried out on the house, and the couple have been subjected to a severe beating which left Chen Guangcheng temporarily unconscious and Yuan Weijing without vision in one eye for several days.</p>\n<p>There is no legal basis for their ongoing detention and we call on you to bring an end to the campaign of violence and intimidation waged against them and to ask you to lift all restrictions without delay. We also seek your personal guarantee that the family will not be subjected to further acts of violence at the hands of personnel employed directly or indirectly by the state.</p>\n<p>[Your name]</p>\n<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4889492683900327351-9132501318248144566?l=freecgc.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n</p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":994,"categories":[1],"tags":[9625]}
