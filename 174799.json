But it gained prominence only after<br />\nit denounced as a rumour the news that the government was burying evidence at<br />\nthe <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/da9df128-b846-11e0-8d23-00144feabdc0.html\" title=\"Chinese media defy censors to attack government on crash - FT.com\">site<br />\nof a rail crash</a> which killed at least 40 people last month.</span></p>\n<p><span>Other bloggers have since been attacking Mr Dou’s campaign<br />\nas an attempt to discredit microblogs in general and to salvage the<br />\ngovernment’s image.</span></p>\n<p><span>“The league is selective in its rumour-busting,” said the<br />\nSouthern Metropolis Daily, a reform-oriented newspaper, in an editorial last<br />\nweek. “It targets only rumours that originate with ordinary people and neglects<br />\nrumours created by the government, and uses official statements as the basis<br />\nand starting point of its [campaigns]”.</span></p>\n<p><span>In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Dou insisted<br />\nhis only motivation was to “serve the truth”. He argued that the rail carriage<br />\nburying was a rumour because the government had said so.</span></p>\n<p><span>But Lao Rong, a blogger who has been one of Mr Dou’s<br />\nfiercest critics, said: “The internet has a self-correcting function, and every<br />\nnetizen has the need and ability to seek the truth, so there’s no need for you<br />\nto act as a judge or referee”.</span></p>\n<p><span>The party traditionally claimed a monopoly on information,<br />\nand required traditional media to distribute content as part of its propaganda<br />\nmachine. Years of market-oriented <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1/2acc2db4-4543-11d9-8fcf-00000e2511c8.html\" title=\"FT.com / Reports - The media: Market the new master\">media reforms </a>and<br />\nthe rise of the internet and particularly of microblogs since late 2009 have<br />\nwatered this down.</span></p>\n<p><span>Beijing has tamed social media through pervasive censorship<br />\nand repression against outspoken bloggers but also tried to be more transparent<br />\nabout issues that attract big attention online. However the regime continues to<br />\nview itself as the sole representative of the absolute truth, frequently<br />\naccusing critics of “incorrect” views and a lack of “objectivity”.</span></p>\n<p><span>The rumour busters’ woes highlight that challenges to this<br />\nclaim are growing.</span></p>\n<p><span>Hu Yong, an expert on Chinese social media, said a<br />\ndistinction needed to be made between rumours, often created by a lack of<br />\ninformation, and lies, intentional fabrications that were a bigger obstruction to<br />\nthe truth. “The best way … would be if the government were open and allowed<br />\ninformation to be transparent,” he said in an interview with Time Weekly, a<br />\nChinese magazine.</span></p>\n<p><span>The party has signalled that it does not intend to respond<br />\nto the challenges by closing down the microblogs.</span></p>\n<p><span>An editorial in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/\" title=\"People's Daily Online - Home Page\">the People’s Daily</a>, the party’s<br />\nmouthpiece, echoed netizens in saying the microblogs possessed innate<br />\ncapability of bringing the truth to light. “The development of the microblogs<br />\nhas only just started. Overall, they make an indispensable contribution to<br />\nfostering citizens’ rights to knowledge, self-expression and supervision”.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Additional<br />\nreporting by Chen Yuanni</span></em><span> </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=738338\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"738338\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":176,"categories":[9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
