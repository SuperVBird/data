Tomorrow, Gmail is rolling out a new feature called Priority Inbox that is going to be a Godsend for those of you who dread opening your email.  In short, Google has built a system that figures out which of your messages are important, and presents them at the top of the screen so you don&#8217;t miss them. The rest of your messages are still there, but you don&#8217;t have to dig through dozens of newsletters and confirmations to find the diamonds in rough.</p>\n<p>The beauty of the system lies in its simplicity — it&#8217;s nearly as easy as Gmail&#8217;s one click spam filter. There&#8217;s almost no setup: once it&#8217;s activated on your account, you&#8217;ll see a prompt asking you if you want to enable Priority Inbox. You can choose from a few options (the order of your various inboxes and if there are any contacts you&#8217;d like to always mark &#8216;Important&#8217;) but don&#8217;t have to setup any rules or &#8216;teach&#8217; Gmail what you want it to mark important. It just works, at least most of the time.</p></div>\n<p><img src=\"http://img.tongji.linezing.com/1017243/tongji.gif\" /><img src=\"http://img.tongji.linezing.com/997968/tongji.gif\" /></p>\n<p>“要翻墙，<a href=\"http://bieyouyongxin.info\" target=\"_blank\">用赛风”</a>.</p>\n","author":176,"categories":[1],"tags":[]}
