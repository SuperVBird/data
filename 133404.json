But, according to a <a href=\"http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/7255759.html\">report</a><br />\nby the country’s state-run news agency, Chinese authorities aren’t ready to<br />\ncede the technology to their critics. </span></p>\n<p><span>Hundreds of public security bureaus in China have launched<br />\ntheir own microblogs, Xinhua said this week, as part of an attempt to better<br />\nconnect with the country’s tech-savvy online population while also leveraging<br />\nsocial media as means to solving criminal cases. </span></p>\n<p><span>So far, the effort seems to garnering some success: “Safe<br />\nBeijing,” the official microblog of the Beijing public security bureau, has<br />\nattracted more than 330,000 followers since its debut in August 2010.</span></p>\n<p><span>The number of registered microblog users in China grew to<br />\n75 million in 2010, from 8 million in 2009, according to a recent report by<br />\nmarket research firm Analysys International, and that figure is expected to 240<br />\nmillion in 2012. Microblogs, known as “weibo” in Mandarin, are fast becoming<br />\none of the primary means by which Chinese web users access news and information<br />\nwith services like Sina.com’s Sina Weibo playing an increasingly important role<br />\nin pushing news coverage of major public affairs. </span></p>\n<p><span>One of last year’s most noted news stories, the<br />\nself-immolation of three Chinese citizens in the Jiangxi Province county of<br />\nYihuang who were protesting the forced demolition of their home, first broke<br />\nand spread on microblogs, forcing mainstream media to break a<br />\ngovernment-imposed silence (<a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/2010-12/02/c_12840791.htm\">in Chinese</a>). In<br />\nanother notable story, blogger and “science cop” Fang Zhouzi, known for<br />\nexposing academic fraud, launched a public outcry and major police<br />\ninvestigation late last August after revealing details of a <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2010/10/14/a-bad-week-for-an-antifraud-activist/\">violent<br />\nattack</a> against him on Sina Weibo <a href=\"http://t.sina.com.cn/fangzhouzi\">account</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>The ability of microblogs to speed the flow of information<br />\nhas proven a headache for China’s censors, leading Internet scholars like<br />\nBeijing University’s Hu Yong to <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/hu2/English\">argue</a> that<br />\nthe technology offers “new possibilities for reshaping China’s authoritarian<br />\nregime.” One way it appears to be reshaping the regime is by forcing government<br />\ndepartments to be more responsive. The Beijing police department, for example,<br />\nmade an announcement (<a href=\"http://huyong.blog.sohu.com/rss\">in<br />\nChinese</a>) on its official microblog account shortly after arresting suspects<br />\nin the Fang Zhouzi case. </span></p>\n<p><span>The first police department to launch an official microblog<br />\nwas the public security bureau in Zhaoqing City in south China’s Guangdong<br />\nProvince, which opened an account on the Sina service in February 2010. Since<br />\nthen, around 500 more microblogs have been opened by local police authorities<br />\nthroughout the country, with some notable success stories. </span></p>\n<p><span>Police from the coastal city of Xiamen, said that their<br />\nmicroblog account helped them catch the murderers of a three-year-old girl<br />\nafter they used it to release details about the murder along with an offer of<br />\n5,000 yuan for further information. The message was forwarded more than 10,000<br />\ntimes, according to a <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-12/01/content_11639430.htm\">report</a><br />\nby China Daily, leading to more than 100 pieces of information police used in<br />\nsolving the case six days later. </span></p>\n<p><span>Other local government agencies have also turned to<br />\nmicroblogs as a way to push out policy announcements and other information, as<br />\nwell as hear complaints from the public. According to Sina’s statistics, 139<br />\ngovernment departments and 56 transportation departments have opened Sina Weibo<br />\naccounts, including the provincial government in Yunnan, whose <a href=\"http://t.sina.com.cn/yunnan\">account</a> has racked up more than 48,800<br />\nfollowers since opening in June last year. </span></p>\n<p><span>“It’s set to be an ongoing trend given that the way people<br />\nobtain information has changed,” said Zhang Yanan, analyst with Beijing-based<br />\nventure capital research firm Zero2IPO. The microblog population has reached<br />\ncritical mass in China Zhang added, with users in the critical 30 to 40 age<br />\ngroup increasing quickly. </span></p>\n<p><span>Public response to the government microblog phenomenon has<br />\nbeen mixed. Many Chinese citizens applaud the effort by government departments<br />\nto engage online, saying that the new technology will help change the stubbon<br />\nimage of government officials and better interact with the public. “Government<br />\nofficials not concerned primarily with keeping their jobs but instead<br />\ninteracting with the public and developing a better understanding of the<br />\npeople’s condition–it’s an improvement,” one Sina user from Guangdong wrote in<br />\nresponse to a recent article on the trend. </span></p>\n<p><span>Some, however, argue that the use of microblogs in and of<br />\nitself does not make for better government.</span></p>\n<p><span>“In many cases, government departments without microblog<br />\naccounts think about the interests of the general public, while those with<br />\nmicroblogs aren’t necessarily serving the public,” writes blogger Zhang Lechen<br />\n(<a href=\"http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4bc425eb0100o98e.html\">in Chinese</a>).<br />\n“I hope it is not for show.” </span></p>\n<p><em><span>– Juliet<br />\nYe.
