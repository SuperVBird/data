As the creator of<br />\n&#8220;Operation Empty Plate&#8221;, an online anti-food-waste campaign, Mr Xu<br />\navoids ordering too much.</span></b></p>\n<p><span>As a child, he toiled in the rice paddies near his tiny village<br />\nin China&#39;s eastern Jiangsu province. &#8220;My parents and my grandparents<br />\neducated me to cherish food,&#8221; Mr Xu explains.</span></p>\n<p><span>After moving to Beijing to work at an agricultural newspaper, Mr<br />\nXu was shocked to see piles of half-finished dishes left on restaurant tables.<br />\nAfter learning that the food wasted by Chinese university students could feed<br />\n10 million people a year, Mr Xu reached his boiling point.</span></p>\n<p><span>In April 2012, he posted a photo on weibo, the Chinese version<br />\nof Twitter, showing his empty plate at the end of a meal. He urged others to do<br />\nthe same.</span></p>\n<p><span>Mr Xu was the first person to promote an anti-waste campaign on<br />\nweibo, although for months Operation Empty Plate received little attention.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;I assumed it would fade out like other weibo<br />\ncampaigns,&#8221; he explains.</span></p>\n<p><span>That is, until Mr Xu received the<br />\nultimate endorsement: from the Communist Party&#39;s new leader, Xi Jinping.</span></p>\n<p><span>On a tour of China&#39;s Hebei province in December, Mr Xi ate a<br />\nsimple meal featuring four dishes and one bowl of soup; a paltry number of<br />\ncourses by Chinese government standards. China&#39;s blogosphere took note;<br />\nOperation Empty Plate&#39;s followers began to climb.</span></p>\n<p><span>One month later, Mr Xi reportedly commented on an article<br />\nmentioning Mr Xu&#39;s &#8220;empty plate&#8221; campaign, remarking: &#8220;These<br />\nwasteful habits must stop immediately!&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span><b><span>&#39;Model behaviour&#39;</span></b></span><span></span></p>\n<p><span>That comment was trumpeted by China&#39;s<br />\nstate-run media. Within a few days, &#8220;Operation Empty Plate&#8221; received<br />\nfront page mentions in the party&#39;s main newspaper, The People&#39;s Daily, and<br />\nappeared as the top story on China&#39;s flagship 1900 television newscast.</span></p>\n<p><span>Operation Empty Plate&#39;s call to stop food wastage was quickly<br />\ntied to Mr Xi&#39;s efforts to battle corruption and party officials&#39; penchants for<br />\nlavish banquets.</span></p>\n<div>\n<h2><span> “Start<br />\nQuote</span></h2>\n</div>\n<p><b><span>&#8220;Today&#39;s<br />\nleaders understand that they have to win the hearts of the people”</span></b></p>\n<p><span><span>Joseph Cheng</span></span><span><span>City University of Hong Kong</span></span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Of course, this is not the first time that China&#39;s propaganda<br />\nmachine has looked to its own people for inspiration.</span></p>\n<p><span>Chinese leaders have a history of highlighting model behaviour<br />\namong ordinary citizens, explains Joseph Cheng, professor of political science<br />\nat the City University of Hong Kong.</span></p>\n<p><span>During the Mao era, a young People&#39;s Liberation Army soldier,<br />\nLei Feng, was martyred as a model Communist following his death at the age of<br />\n21.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, it is rare for an internet movement to receive<br />\nhigh-level government backing. More often, the Chinese government has censored<br />\nthe content on Chinese internet forums.</span></p>\n<p><span>This time, Xi Jinping chose to support Operation Empty Plate<br />\nbecause it was a non-controversial message certain to receive popular support.</span></p>\n<p><span>Today&#39;s leaders, Joseph Cheng explains, &#8220;understand that<br />\nthey have to win the hearts of the people, especially when establishing one&#39;s<br />\nleadership&#8221;.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another campaign that started on weibo, promoting an attempt to<br />\nfind children who had been trafficked in China, also received a thumbs-up from<br />\nthe government. China&#39;s Ministry of Public Security asked citizens to call the<br />\npolice if they spotted child beggars on the streets.</span></p>\n<p><span><b><span>Online activism</span></b></span><span></span></p>\n<p><span>At the moment, the government ignores<br />\ncampaigns that do not match its agenda, explains Hu Yong, a Beijing academic<br />\nwho studies Chinese social media.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;For example,&#8221; Prof Hu says, &#8220;many people are<br />\ndemanding that officials make their assets public. The government always<br />\nignores this appeal.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>As internet users become bolder and more vocal in launching<br />\ncampaigns, Prof Hu says, Beijing will face pressure to respond to the demands<br />\nof its people.</span></p>\n<p><span>More than 400 million people in China have weibo accounts and<br />\nanother one billion Chinese citizens are connected by mobile phones.</span></p>\n<p><span>Over the next few years, most Chinese people will upgrade to<br />\ndata-rich smart phones, making it even more difficult for government censors to<br />\ncontrol the ways in which information will be shared among the population.</span></p>\n<p><span>Chinese citizens are now responsible for 30,000 to 50,000<br />\nso-called &#8220;mass incidents&#8221; every year, according to Chen Jinping,<br />\noutgoing deputy of the Party&#39;s Committee of Political and Legislative Affairs.</span></p>\n<p><span>At a press conference this week, Mr Chen admitted the popularity<br />\nof mobile phones and Chinese internet forums gave unhappy citizens an outlet to<br />\nvent their anger.</span></p>\n<p><span>For now, China&#39;s party leader was able to satisfy one formerly<br />\nunhappy citizen. Over the last few bites of a filling lunch, Xu Zhijun predicts<br />\nthat more internet users will get the government&#39;s attention during Xi<br />\nJinping&#39;s era.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;I hear that Xi is even going to get his own weibo<br />\naccount,&#8221; Mr Xu smiles. &#8220;It&#39;s a good thing for him to communicate with<br />\nus ordinary people.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=b4fd4ae247\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/mstlf\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[5908,8339,16912,8923]}
