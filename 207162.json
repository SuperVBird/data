Wang noted the difficulties involved in tying internet<br />\nusers&#8217; actual identities to the national ID numbers used for registration,<br />\nconsidering the ease with which users could register accounts using others&#8217; ID<br />\ninformation &#8212; and the potential exploitation of ID data by hackers. Wang also<br />\ncited the incompleteness of legal protection for online real-name registration<br />\nas a concern.</span></p>\n<p><span>Li Fang, standing deputy chief editor of Tencent<br />\n(0700.HK), predicted that the number of microblog users would increase by up to<br />\n80% in 2012, creating an ever greater need for data security. While all major<br />\nportals have online security teams numbering in the hundreds of employees, Li<br />\nsaid, it remains impossible to guarantee user data security &#8212; meaning that<br />\nreal-name registration will require great caution on the part of operators.</span></p>\n<p><span>Zhao Feng, director of online forum site Xici.net, said<br />\nthat websites were limited in their ability to address internet security issues<br />\nthrough technology, and that it would remain important to increase user<br />\nawareness of security and to ensure legislative provisions for data security.</span></p>\n<p><span>Chen Yong, deputy chief editor of Tianya, said that a<br />\nroadmap for nationwide implementation of real-name registration policies would<br />\nbe necessary. Real-name registration remains under exploration, Chen said, and<br />\nis only feasible at present for backend registration of a small number of<br />\nusers, to be registered in stages. In the case of Tianya&#8217;s forums, for<br />\ninstance, moderators and opinion leaders have had their identities verified by<br />\nthe site, while for ordinary users only methods generally considered more<br />\nsecure, such as mobile phone registration, are feasible. To date, several<br />\nmillion Tianya users have opted for mobile phone verification.</span></p>\n<p><span>Website operators are businesspeople first, Chen said, and<br />\nhave their own long-term development to consider. A full-scale implementation<br />\nof real-name registration, with a complicated verification workflow, could<br />\ncause sites to lose large numbers of potential users &#8212; requiring sites to<br />\ngrant special privileges or incentives to users who opt for verification, which<br />\n&#8212; when combined with a sizable investment in security systems &#8212; would<br />\nincrease the cost to operators of implementing real-name registration.</span></p>\n<p><span>Sohu (Nasdaq: SOHU) deputy chief editor Fang Gang was<br />\nrelatively sanguine regarding implementing back-end real-name registration for<br />\ninternet communities. Fang cited the relative ease of implementation and the<br />\npotential of a real-name registration system to make users &#8220;more<br />\nresponsible for their speech&#8221; as positives, but noted that users would<br />\nalso have to see personal benefits, such as copyright protection for their<br />\nonline comments.</span></p>\n<p><span>Hu Yong, an associate professor at the Peking University<br />\nSchool of Journalism and Communication, said that Chinese society had entered a<br />\nphase in which different social strata could vie for primacy using emerging<br />\ntechnologies &#8212; meaning that the government would be required to offer clear<br />\ncommunications and beneficial services in addressing the &#8220;online discourse<br />\ncrisis&#8221; in order to create a more responsible internet user base.</span></p>\n<p><span>Zou Ming, VP of Phoenix New Media&#8217;s internet portal iFeng,<br />\nsaid that Chinese internet users had seen an unprecedented increase in<br />\nawareness and sophistication over the last decade, and that improvements to the<br />\nonline environment would essentially be contingent upon social progress.</span></p>\n<p><span>Sanya municipal deputy director of propaganda Jian<br />\nQiuxiong said that real-name registration would be a means of imposing online<br />\norder and making internet users responsible for their online comments, and<br />\nwould have little actual effect on governmental efforts to oversee and direct<br />\npublic discourse. At present, many internet users responding to real-name<br />\nregistration are signing their own names and leaving their phone numbers. The<br />\ngovernment should respect online public opinion, Jian said, and should shift<br />\nits efforts from eliminating online discourse to addressing real-world<br />\nproblems.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1000,"categories":[9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
