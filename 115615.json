Since the Chinese government will not give me a passport, I am<br />unable to come and accept this honor in person. But my spirit cannot be locked away,<br />and I feel I am with you now, touched by your kind encouragement.</p>\n<p>I am not really a journalist or media person in the traditional sense. In this Age of the<br />Internet, I have taken my books, my blog, my regular commentaries for radio, Twitter,<br />and Facebook—as well as a camera, a camcorder, and the interviews I give reporters—<br />and combined them into a new medium: a one-person medium. I began deliberately<br />using this approach in March of 2008. At that time, protests which had spread across<br />Tibet were being violently suppressed, but the Chinese government was using its<br />monopoly on information to make sure people could hear only its distorted account,<br />blasted at high volume. The might of this world was asserting its power over the facts,<br />and I realized that unless I could find some way, working by myself, to record what was<br />happening and get the news out, the anguish of an entire people would vanish forever<br />behind a veil of darkness. History would be rewritten; memories would be buried; our<br />descendants would never know the sacrifices their ancestors had made.</p>\n<p>I was then in Beijing, the imperial capital. Using both traditional and modern tools of<br />communication, I contacted people on the scene and wove a network that covered all the<br />Tibetan lands. Some of my sources were acquaintances; others I had never met. With<br />their help I gathered factual accounts of what was happening, and each day posted the<br />information to my blog so that the world could know, in real time, how Tibet was being<br />engulfed in blood and fire. At that time I was the only channel through which Tibetans<br />inside the PRC could make their voices heard, and my blog received several million hits,<br />as the work of one person standing against the propaganda machine of a colossal State.</p>\n<p>I want to thank these friends of mine, though I cannot mention their names; we<br />supported and encouraged each other through those hard days. Though we found<br />ourselves in different places, we had all become witnesses and reporters at the same<br />epochal moment in history. I remember what a young Tibetan told me from Lhasa late<br />one night, just after the protests erupted: “Although we often have the words<br />&#8216;nationality&#8217; and &#8216;Tibet&#8217; on our lips, when things get really bad it&#8217;s usually the humblest<br />stratum of the common people who take the risks and step out in front. They&#8217;re a lot<br />braver than we are.” But in fact this young man was seized for taking photographs and<br />was detained for nearly two months.</p>\n<p>My blog was destroyed by hackers and my Skype account was hijacked. Each day was<br />like combat, with events in constant flux as on a battlefield. Again and again, my<br />friends helped me keep going. In the face of constant threats from the political police, I<br />packed a small bag with articles I would need in prison and kept it within reach.</p>\n<p>Later I traveled through the Tibetan region taking notes and pictures. The entire journey<br />I was followed and repeatedly intercepted and questioned. The police limited my<br />contacts with Tibetans and interrogated any who had dealings with me. They were<br />trying to make me someone no one would talk to. While I was in Lhasa, a squad of<br />police raided my mother&#8217;s apartment and took me away after searching my room and<br />confiscating my materials. It was on account of the Beijing Olympics which were then<br />underway. Eventually they let me go. This experience is actually not unusual for<br />Tibetans living under dictatorship.</p>\n<p>Even now, every kind of inhumanity and injustice is still being visited upon Tibet.<br />Many outstanding people, innocent people, have been arrested and sentenced and are<br />suffering unimaginable torment. I will keep my one-person media operation going, for<br />it is the weapon of the powerless. To be sure, this weapon consists of the written word;<br />it rests on principles of nonviolence and noncooperation; it draws its energy from our<br />religion, traditions, and culture, as well as the broken condition to which we have been<br />reduced; these provide the strength with which we resist oppression and are the reason<br />why I will never give up or compromise. The support that comes in from every side,<br />including from you, is a lasting source of my courage.</p>\n<p>Tashi Delek!</p>\n<p>August 28, 2010<br />Beijing</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/101413679960970342-1409192972310314404?l=woeser.middle-way.net\" width=\"1\" /></div></p>\n","author":176,"categories":[1],"tags":[14755,8782]}
