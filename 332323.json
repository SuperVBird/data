Generally, commentators heaped uncritical praise on the movie and TV mogul for his achievements, his &#8216;almost heroic, single-handed effort to build the movie industry&#8217;, and his charity efforts after he made his billions.

They ignore how Shaw had turned his studio into a production-line factory mass-producing low-quality &#8216;products&#8217;. Nearly all newspaper articles preferred to focus on his &#8216;contributions&#8217;.
