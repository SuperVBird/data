Chu&#8217;s work reinterprets the story with clay puppets, creating an encounter between the mural&#8217;s depiction and her own reworking of it.<br />Belgian artist Kris Martin is filling the aisle of a church with coins and Ugo Rondinone is presenting gnarled and twisted sculptures in the same church&#8217;s courtyard.<br />The River Rhine will be brightened by colored kites hanging from trees along its bank, courtesy of Shonibare, while Costa Rican painter Federico Herrero has built frames around the walls of four fishermen&#8217;s houses along the river and painted brightly colored patterns onto them.<br />&#8220;I have this intention of inserting a landscape within the previous landscape, so that you have another perspective and you activate something very different in the area,&#8221; Herrero explained.<br />&#8220;I would say that most of the pieces in the Art Parcours program somehow don&#8217;t relate or function inside of the traditional gallery or white cube, so they have this idea of somehow activating the city or changing how you get to know a city through the public space,&#8221; he said.<br />Global roundup: This season&#8217;s must-see exhibitions<br />Locals who witnessed him painting the houses seemed pleased, he said, that he was working in the neighborhood and taking art out of the museum or gallery and into the community &#8212; and brightening it up in the process.<br />Such local approval is exactly what curator Hoffman had in mind when he first came up with the idea for the project, which is now in its second year.<br />&#8220;Art Parcours is an off-side event that is connected to the main fair but is disconnected from just being purely about the market,&#8221; he said.<br />&#8220;I like the idea of the neighbors bumping into (the work) and having some kind of reaction to it,&#8221; said Herrero.<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s where the Parcours bit comes in,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4214948278400391962-2541269139152244147?l=loveaiww.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/loveAiWeiwei/~4/SDB6ox4HkvI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":699,"categories":[1],"tags":[9484]}
