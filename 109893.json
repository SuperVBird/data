These consultative documents<br />\nformed the basis of the Committee&#8217;s response to the financial<br />\ncrisis and are part of the global initiatives to strengthen the<br />\nfinancial regulatory system that have been endorsed by the G20<br />\nLeaders. The GHOS subsequently agreed on key design elements of the<br />\nreform package at its July 2010 meeting and on the calibration and<br />\ntransition to implement the measures at its September 2010<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nBasel III is part of the Committee&#8217;s continuous effort to enhance<br />\nthe banking regulatory framework.
