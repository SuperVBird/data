Former leader Deng Xiaoping is supposed to have declared that to get rich was glorious – and China’s people have taken him at his word.</p>\n<p>The wealthy were at one time persecuted – now they are viewed with respect.</p>\n<p>And their numbers are growing. There are now more than one million dollar millionaires in China – and many millions more behind them who hope to emulate their success.</p>\n<p><strong>High-end hopefuls</strong></p>\n<p>Li Yang, who runs a business selling construction materials, is one of these hopefuls.</p>\n<p>The 25-year-old was in the Beijing Old Car Market, in the south of the city, with a group of friends, all of them looking to buy a car.</p>\n<p>He only had enough money for a cheap vehicle, but could not stop himself popping in to look at some of the high-end models on sale.</p>\n<p>Mr Li, from Shandong province, had his eye on a nearly new Bentley costing 3.4m yuan ($525,000, £320,000).</p>\n<p>“I’d like to buy a car like this because it would raise my status – people would look at me differently,” he said.</p>\n<p>There was a similar comment from oil worker Li Hongquan, as he circled a clutch of shiny Land Rovers parked together.</p>\n<p>“If a man drives a car like this it shows he has power and success,” said the 45-year-old, who hopes to be able to afford one of the motors in a few years.</p>\n<p><strong>Change in attitude</strong></p>\n<p>There has been a change in attitudes over the past 15 years towards people who have money, according to Rupert Hoogewerf, who runs the Hurun Report, a Shanghai-based company that publishes rich lists.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ohmymedia.info/bbc%EF%BC%9Awhats-driving-chinas-pursuit-of-financial-success%EF%BC%9F.html/_53265615_lihongquan\"><img title=\"_53265615_lihongquan\" src=\"http://www.ohmymedia.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/53265615_lihongquan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"304\" height=\"171\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Oil worker Li Hongquan is working towards a luxury car and believes it represents power and success.</em></p>\n<p>He said previously people with money had sometimes acquired it through connections rather than because of any skill.</p>\n<p>“But entrepreneurs are now pretty respected for being very savvy and able business people,” said Mr Hoogewerf.</p>\n<p>“Several have become superstar entrepreneurs who have inspired young people to start their own companies.”</p>\n<p>This love of money – and respect for those who have it – has led to some interesting business opportunities.</p>\n<p>A Beijing company is offering expensive 30-hour courses to young women on how to win the heart of a rich man. It has already trained hundreds of hopefuls.</p>\n<p>The school also offers wealthy men – for a cost – the chance to meet eligible women.</p>\n<p><strong>Widening wealth gap</strong></p>\n<p>But not everyone approves of these aspirations. Education officials in Guangdong province are piloting a scheme to teach young women about the dangers of becoming a rich man’s mistress; loving money too much.</p>\n<p>And even those shopping for designer goods in Sanlitun Village, an upmarket shopping centre in Beijing, are not entirely comfortable with the way things are.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ohmymedia.info/bbc%EF%BC%9Awhats-driving-chinas-pursuit-of-financial-success%EF%BC%9F.html/_53265618_yangshunli\"><img title=\"_53265618_yangshunli\" src=\"http://www.ohmymedia.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/53265618_yangshunli.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"226\" height=\"282\" /></a><em>Yang Shunli with his electric bike: ‘It’s just a car, they are no better than me.</em></p>\n<p>Many think China’s pursuit of wealth has created losers as well as winners.</p>\n<p>The widening wealth gap is regularly cited as one of the country’s main problems in surveys of social attitudes.</p>\n<p>These well-heeled shoppers acknowledged China’s amazing economic development since it opened to the outside world 30 years ago, but they are also worried about the problems that still need solving.</p>\n<p>“The government’s been trying its hardest to increase GDP – it’s going up quickly every year. But ordinary people’s living standards are not going up as fast,” said one man, who declined to give his name.</p>\n<p>And although most people in China, like elsewhere in the world, want to improve their lives, not everyone wants a billionaire’s lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Riding his electric bike, Yang Shunli regularly delivers food and water to those who work at the luxury hall of the second-hand car market.</p>\n<p>“I don’t envy people who can afford cars like that. It’s just a car, they are no better than me,” said the 18-year-old, before riding off for his next delivery.</p>\n<p><strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.ohmymedia.info/?ak_action=api_record_view&#038;id=8945&#038;type=feed\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<hr>\n<p><small>© Sunkist Chan for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ohmymedia.info\">新闻理想档案馆</a>, 2011/06/22. |<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ohmymedia.info/bbc%EF%BC%9Awhats-driving-chinas-pursuit-of-financial-success%EF%BC%9F.html\">Permalink</a> |<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ohmymedia.info/category/%E6%94%B6%E5%90%AC%E6%95%8C%E5%8F%B0\" title=\"查看 收听敌台 的全部文章\">收听敌台</a><br />\n<br />\nPost tags: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ohmymedia.info/tag/bbc\">BBC</a><br />\n</small></p>\n<p><strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://t.sina.com.cn/ohmm\">OMM通讯社@新浪微博</a></strong> | <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://twitter.com/ohmymedia\">OhMyMedia@Twitter</a></strong> | <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://t.qq.com/OMMinfo\">OMM通讯社@腾讯微博</a></strong><br />\n<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ohmymedia.info/?page_id=3165\"><strong>加入我们，OMM通讯社志愿者招募！</strong></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oh-my-media/~4/SaHQfrEyYbY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":448,"categories":[1],"tags":[]}
