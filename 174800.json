This debate seemed to cap a summer in which platforms<br />\nlike Sina Microblog and QQ Microblog have had a dramatic impact on such stories<br />\nas the Red Cross Society of China (&#8220;Guo Meimei&#8221;) scandal and problems<br />\nfacing China&#39;s high-speed rail network. But much of the doubting about the<br />\nethics of social media angered Chinese internet users, who saw attempts to<br />\nbroad-brush platforms like Sina Microblog as rumor mills as just the latest<br />\naction to control information. Some of the most intelligent writing on the<br />\nissue of &#8220;rumor,&#8221; &#8220;truth&#8221; and social media has been that of<br />\nCMP fellow and Peking University professor Hu Yong (</span></em></span><em><span>胡泳<span>), who has<br />\ndrawn a clear line between official press control policies, the crisis of<br />\ncredibility facing official news, and the general appeal of hearsay. The<br />\nfollowing is a partial translation of an essay by Hu Yong that appeared in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.eeo.com.cn/2011/0812/208724.shtml\">August 12 edition of the<br />\nEconomic Observer</a>. The points Hu makes are of particular relevance to the<br />\nprevailing silence now over protests yesterday in the city of Dalian. As<br />\ncontrols were strictly in force over this story, social media provided the only<br />\nsource of information.</span></span></em></p>\n<p><em><span><span><br /></span></span></em></p>\n<p><span>This is an age pervaded by rumor. On July 28, People&#8217;s<br />\nDaily Online summed up eight big rumors surrounding the Wenzhou train<br />\ncollision. On August 3, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cctv.com/news/special/C15823/20060531/100235.shtml\">China<br />\nCentral Television&#8217;s <em><span>Morning<br />\nNews</span></em> program reported under the title &#8220;Where is the ethical<br />\nbottom line on microblogs?&#8221;</a> the story of how one user on QQ Microblog<br />\ncalled &#8220;Guo Yao&#8221; (</span>郭瑶<span>) had impersonated the<br />\nrelative of a crash victim. </span></p>\n<p><span>In the CCTV report, a member of the so-called Anti-Rumor<br />\nLeague, [identified as] “a group of self-organizing enthusiastic web users<br />\nworking as rumor busting volunteers,” endorsed the idea of a “moral bankruptcy”<br />\n(</span>沦丧<span>) in the ethics of microblogs. This group, formed on<br />\nMay 18 [this year], says that it has thus far been involved in the busting of<br />\nmore than one-hundred [online] rumors. But it was in the midst of the incident<br />\nof the [Wenzhou] train collision [on July 23] that the group was cast into some<br />\ndoubt, accused of “selectively busting rumors” (</span>选择性辟谣<span>)<br />\nand “only busting popular rumors, not busting official rumors” [or falsehoods]<br />\n(</span>只辟民谣，不辟官谣<span>). Some even suggested in the fiercest of<br />\nwords that the Anti-Rumor League was “a platform carrying out directed attacks<br />\nfrom a predefined political position as it hoists the signboard of rumor<br />\nbusting.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Li Mu (</span>李牧<span>), a core figure in the<br />\nLeague, also admits that it was wrong of the Anti-Rumor League to trust overly<br />\nin the Ministry of Railways during the “7.23″ incident. Excessive trust in the<br />\ndeclarations of the government, and the use of official government news<br />\nreleases in countering many rumors is a major defect of the Anti-Rumor League.<br />\nThe publicity slogan of the Anti-Rumor League is “serving the truth” (</span>为真相服务<span>), but there’s a little something about the operation of current<br />\npolitics that everyone is clear about, and that is that the government is not<br />\njust a natural provider of the truth. Very often, it is the government that is<br />\nguilty of the “original sin,” and harboring skepticism towards it is very<br />\nreasonable. </span></p>\n<p><span>As for the charge of “selectively busting rumors,” the<br />\nprincipal founder of the Anti-Rumor League, Wu Fatian (</span>吴法天<span>), has responded: “The orientation of the Anti-Rumor League is about<br />\nbeing a spontaneous organization of self-discipline among web users in the We<br />\nMedia age, and what it mainly does is issue accurate information about<br />\nmicroblog rumors, so it works through microblog posting by the public.” At<br />\nfirst glance, it seems this starting off point would yield few misgivings.<br />\nMicroblogs are certainly not a clean and blameless territory, and spontaneous<br />\npopular action to exercise self-discipline over speech on microblogs accords<br />\nwith the basic character of self organization in the We Media era. But if we<br />\nlook more carefully, the act of chiefly targeting “popular rumors” in rumor<br />\nbusting actually suggests a major deficiency of wisdom: it perhaps actively<br />\ncovers up or passively overlooks a hard fact of contemporary society, which is<br />\nthat official lies (</span>官方的谎言<span>) outpace popular rumors,<br />\nconstituting the greatest interference and obstruction with the truth. </span></p>\n<p><span>When the goal of busting rumors is to get at the truth this<br />\nis a good thing. But if rumor busters stand solely on the side of the<br />\ngovernment to blacken and attack popular public opinion, this isn’t in the<br />\ninterest of discovering the facts and the truth but in fact serves the goal of<br />\nso-called channeling of public opinion (</span>舆论引导<span>), thereby<br />\nserving as a tool aiding and abetting those people and organizations that<br />\nendeavor to twist the truth. </span></p>\n<p><span>In many online incidents, “strengthening channeling of<br />\npublic opinion” and “handling rumor according to the law” have appeared in the<br />\nsame directives [from press control authorities], and this is a tactic we have<br />\nseen from the government for a long time. We can say that in fact it is the<br />\nconduct of “strengthening channeling of public opinion” that has caused<br />\nofficial information to be so wanting in credibility, which has in turn<br />\nnurtured a rich soil for the transmission of “rumors.” On the one hand, the<br />\ngovernment has provided an environment conducive to the spread of rumors, and<br />\non the other it sternly lashes out against rumors, placing itself in the midst<br />\nof an insoluble contradiction. </span></p>\n<p><span>Since the SARS epidemic in 2003, the massive losses and<br />\nrisks that come with the suppression of media coverage of sudden-breaking<br />\nincidents by relevant government departments have been illustrated again and<br />\nagain. As the media say nothing, or become representatives of the discourse of<br />\nthose in power, this inevitably becomes the principal reason for the spread of<br />\nrumor and social panic. </span></p>\n<p><span>Under [the policy of] “correct guidance of public opinion”<br />\nthe traditional media only selectively report major social and political<br />\nevents, and the standards are entirely within their hands. Whatever is regarded<br />\nas negative (</span>反面<span>), destructive (</span>消极<span>), disturbing (</span>添乱<span>), discrediting (</span>抹黑<span>) is not permitted, and everything that is regarded as positive (</span>正面<span>), constructive (</span>积极<span>), encouraging (</span>鼓劲<span>) and praising (</span>添彩<span>) is openly proclaimed.<br />\nTheir basic criterion for deciding [what is positive or negative] is whether or<br />\nnot something poses a danger to social stability, and they care nothing for<br />\nwhether or not damage is done to the public’s right to know, or whether their<br />\nactions might pose a grave danger to the life and property of the people. </span></p>\n<p><span>When normal social communication mechanisms are crippled,<br />\nabnormal communication mechanisms will be enlivened. Hearsay about<br />\nsudden-breaking incidents is mostly transmitted by word of mouth, through<br />\ninstant messaging, online forums (and later added to microblogs), and<br />\ncommunication much earlier than for formal releases in newspapers, television,<br />\nradio and other traditional forms of media. People are much more inclined to<br />\nbelieve rumors of uncertain provenance than they are to believe official news<br />\nreports by newspapers, television and other mass media, which creates a<br />\nsituation in which “news looks like rumor and rumor looks like news.” Under the<br />\ncontrol of the government, transmission methods that are twisted by<br />\nadministrative power have exactly the opposite of their intended effect in an<br />\nenvironment in which rumors are widely disseminated. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":176,"categories":[9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
