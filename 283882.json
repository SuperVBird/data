But this year&#39;s Bookworm<br />\nLiterary Festival (BLF), running from March 8 to 22, promises to be anything<br />\nbut perfunctory, bringing an impressive and international mix of collaborations<br />\nto the capital. </p>\n<p>The 2013 opening party for the BLF will kick off Friday at 7 pm at the<br />\nBookworm, featuring author Lionel Shriver &#8211; the name behind Orange<br />\nPrize-winner We Need to Talk About Kevin<i> </i>and more<br />\nrecently The New Republic, followed by a performance by American<br />\nindie-folk-pop musician Joe Gil. </p>\n<p>Since its beginnings in 2007, the nationwide festival has tweaked and added<br />\nmore to the mix; this year welcomes 80 authors from 18 countries.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>What&#39;s new </span></b><span></p>\n<p>Chen Mengfei, program assistant and media liaison of the BLF, says the big<br />\nchange in this year&#39;s festival is the larger Chinese program. The festival on<br />\nwheels will hit Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Suzhou, Ningbo, Chengdu and<br />\nChongqing, featuring readings, performance poetry, panels and discussions for<br />\nChinese audiences, all for free. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The BLF is an English language festival … but a lot of what we do is<br />\nabout engagement, introducing foreign authors to Chinese audiences, and vice<br />\nversa. Interesting things happen when you have the Chinese and international<br />\nmix,&#8221; said Kadi Hughes, director of BLF. </p>\n<p>Hughes added that one of the main focuses of the BLF was partnering with<br />\ninteresting people to ensure it reached broad demographic across age and<br />\nnationality. &#8220;Literature is something for everyone … sometimes people<br />\nthink only a certain type of person will go to a book talk, but there&#39;s a lot<br />\nof diversity,&#8221; said Hughes.  </p>\n<p>While every expat learns the whereabouts of the Bookworm shortly after settling<br />\ndown in Beijing, the store is still something new for many locals. Cherry Yu is<br />\nan Anhui Province native and first-time volunteer at this year&#39;s festival. She<br />\nsaid that among her Chinese colleagues at a foreign enterprise in Beijing, only<br />\na handful know about the festival.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;I registered to sign up for their newsletter, and when I saw the<br />\nnewsletter calling for volunteers this year, I thought it would be a good<br />\nchance to get involved,&#8221; she said. </p>\n<p>Two other new events this year are the Future Perfect panel, which discusses<br />\nthe future of the society, and the Big Questions series, which will gather<br />\nthinkers. The program this year includes different artistic programs such as<br />\ncomedy and plays, to draw on Beijing&#39;s vibrant artistic space.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>Process</span></b><span></p>\n<p>The process of choosing the writers for the festival is a yearlong effort,<br />\nbeginning from the end of the last BLF. </p>\n<p>&#8220;From May to November, it&#39;s a constant process. We put together a<br />\nwish-list of people and around November, invitations go out. It&#39;s a long<br />\nprocess, because people have to be able to make it here,&#8221; said Chen. </p>\n<p>This year features with many established authors, like Lionel Shriver, in<br />\nconversation with debut writers like Sifiso Mzobe and Chinese figures. Hu Yong,<br />\na popular social media critic, for example, will be participating in a panel<br />\nabout social media alongside Duncan Hewitt, author of Get Rich First. </p>\n<p>&#8220;This is really a nationwide festival,&#8221; Hughes emphasizes.<br />\n&#8220;After seven years, we&#39;re lucky that we have a great reputation and<br />\nwriters want to [participate]. We see what other festivals do and tweak<br />\nit.&#8221; </p>\n<p>For the selection of the Chinese authors, the Bookworm works closely with Paper<br />\nRepublic and Pathlight magazine. All talks at the Bookworm will be in English;<br />\nauthors that don&#39;t speak English will have a translator.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#39;s good to see authors speak because their writing might come across<br />\none way, and speaking another,&#8221; said Hughes. </p>\n<p>Tickets are available for purchase at the Bookworm, from 9 am to 9 pm.
