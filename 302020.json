The Hebei man, who was convicted of raping and killing three<br />\nwomen in 1994 and 1995, is appealing his death sentence, asking for<br />\nleniency because he confessed to a fourth murder case.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But a prosecutor with the Higher People’s Court, in provincial<br />\ncapital Shijiazhuang, said Wang&#8217;s reason for appealing was not<br />\nvalid. &#8220;Crucial&#8221; details provided by Wang &#8220;significantly<br />\nmismatched&#8221; evidence found at the crime scene of the fourth case,<br />\nthe prosecutor said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“If it were this simple, why did it take eight full years for<br />\nHebei to present the evidence?” prominent Peking University law<br />\nprofessor He Weifang wrote on Weibo after the prosecutor tried to<br />\ndismiss Wang’s appeal. “Are they really impartial?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Wang had confessed to four murders after he was arrested in<br />\n2005, but he was convicted in only three of them. Another man,<br />\n20-year-old Nie Shubin, had taken the fall for an August 1994 rape<br />\nand murder of a woman in a Shijiazhuang suburb.<br />\nNie was executed in 1995.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At the time, Wang&#8217;s confession shocked observers across China.<br />\nLegal scholars and activists were surprised again after Hebei’s<br />\ncourt charged Wang for only three murders, ignoring the fourth.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge irony,” law professor He said in<br />\nan earlier interview with Chinese media. “While Wang yells,<br />\n‘There’s this other crime I committed. Convict me<br />\nplease!’,  the court tells him, ‘Oh no, we are<br />\nonly after your other crimes&#8217;.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Wang wasn’t aware of Nie’s conviction at the time of his<br />\nconfession, nor did he know Nie. He admitted to have acted alone,<br />\naccording to Chinese media reports. Wang was sentenced in 2007 and<br />\npromptly appealed. He argued that the court had failed to charge<br />\nhim for the August 1994 murder, and he demanded leniency because of<br />\nhis contribution in proving Nie&#8217;s innocence.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The court has not absolved Nie&#8217;s name since, prompting criticism<br />\nfrom He, who said China’s judicial system had failed to recognise<br />\nand correct its fatal mistake. “It fell on the real murderer to<br />\nclear Nie’s name, which is such a shame,” he had said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Nie&#8217;s mother, Zhang Huanzhi, was allowed to sit in<br />\non the proceedings, according to Hebei court authorities. Zhang has<br />\nsaid her son had confessed to the crime after being tortured, and<br />\nshe has since been petitioning to rescind Nie’s conviction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“The only reason my husband and I have lived until now is to see<br />\nour son’s name cleared,” Zhang once said in an interview with<br />\nChinese media.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The prosecutor said on Tuesday that Wang<br />\nhad failed to mention a coloured blouse wrapped<br />\naround the victim’s neck when the body was found. He had also<br />\nerroneously described the victim’s height. Wang was also questioned<br />\non the method he had claimed to use in the killing: an autopsy<br />\nshowed no fractures endured by the victim, but Wang had claimed he<br />\nstomped on her chest after strangling her, the court heard.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Based on these discrepancies, the prosecutor dismissed Wang&#8217;s<br />\nclaim that he was the murderer.</p>\n<p>Wang’s lawyer on Tuesday morning responded by requesting to<br />\nreview the prosecutor&#8217;s evidence. The court said it had granted the<br />\nrequest, and would resume the trial on an unspecified date.</p>\n<p>The trial on Tuesday was broadcasted live, eliciting angry<br />\ncomments on the official Weibo page of Hebei&#8217;s higher court, many<br />\nof them referring to the fact that Wang&#8217;s case is now being tried<br />\nin the same court that convicted Nie.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>&#8220;You are insulting everyone&#8217;s intelligence,&#8221; said a<br />\nmicroblogger.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>&#8220;These shameless people keep lying to cover up their own<br />\nmistake,&#8221; said many others.</p>\n<p>“The defendant tries every means to have himself convicted, and<br />\nthe Hebei prosecutor does everything to prove his innocence,” the<br />\nlaw professor, He, commented on Weibo on Tuesday. “What an amazing<br />\ncase.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"450\" height=\"309\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=2ea93c5b7b\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/msuvD\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1000,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[9378]}
