It was a Sunday morning in early<br />\nApril, and Wang Bo — an Internet animator better known to his legions of online<br />\nfans by his nickname, Pi San — ignored the call at first. He wanted no<br />\nintrusions. A compact 40-year-old with short-cropped hair and arched eyebrows<br />\nthat give him a look of permanent bemusement, Pi San is most famous for<br />\ncreating a mischievous cartoon character named Kuang Kuang, but he earns money<br />\nby making animations for corporations, and he was on a deadline. Pi San had<br />\nbicycled to his studio in a defunct factory building on the outskirts of<br />\nBeijing that morning, hoping to finish up some work in peace. But the buzzing<br />\nof the phone didn’t stop.</span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span> </span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>Multimedia</span></b><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/10/30/magazine/26mag-chinese-animations.html?ref=magazine\"><span>The Controversial Cartoons of<br />\nPi San</span></a></span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Despite strict censorship, the Internet is flourishing as the wittiest<br />\nspace in China due to a humorous subculture of coded languages and ironic<br />\nanimated shorts from netizens.

Pi San spat out a profanity. Over the previous six<br />\nweeks, hundreds of bloggers — lawyers, activists, journalists — had vanished<br />\ninto police custody in one of the harshest assaults on social activism in<br />\ndecades. Now they had Ai — fat, brilliant, bombastic and internationally<br />\nrenowned. If Ai could be arrested, was any independent thinker in China safe?</span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Pi San had reason to be scared. He and Ai were friends. A<br />\nfew weeks earlier, over lunch, the two artists talked about collaborating on a<br />\nsatirical Internet animation. Though a bit wary of Ai’s Web activism, Pi San<br />\nadmired his daring solo exhibitions in New York, Berlin and London. The most<br />\nrecent show had consisted of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/arts/design/19sunflower.html\"><span>100<br />\nmillion sunflower seeds made of porcelain</span></a>, laid out across the floor<br />\nof the Tate Modern, which visitors were invited to walk upon. Some considered<br />\nthe seeds to be symbols of the downtrodden Chinese people.</span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Despite his fear, Pi San quickly posted the news about<br />\nAi’s detention on Sina Weibo, China’s closely monitored equivalent of Twitter<br />\nand the fastest-growing Internet platform in the world. An invisible censor<br />\ndeleted the message in seconds. He then tried posting, without comment, a<br />\ncartoon drawing of Ai, the better to evade China’s word-sensitive filtering<br />\nsoftware. But the image disappeared, too — a sign that a human being, not<br />\ncomputer software, had deleted the drawing. Pi San told his Weibo followers:<br />\n“Again I was ‘harmonized.’ It’s just a picture!”</span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Now the creative synapses started firing. “I had to do<br />\nsomething to lift the fear,” Pi San told me later. “Others might write or<br />\nprotest; I make animations.” He and a colleague worked feverishly through the<br />\nnight on a 54-second flash animation entitled <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/video-behind-chinas-great-firewall-subversive-content-cartoon-form\"><span>“Crack<br />\nSunflower Seeds.”</span></a>The animation takes place in Kuang Kuang’s school,<br />\nwhere a little girl is speaking over the loudspeakers. “Once upon a time,” she<br />\nbegins, “there was a Chinese man selling sunflower seeds.” Suddenly, a black<br />\ncartoon hand yanks her off the set. A succession of trembling announcers tries<br />\nto tell the same story, but the black hand pulls them off too, each time more<br />\nquickly than the last.</span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Finally, it is Kuang Kuang’s turn. The boy hems and haws<br />\nand, giving up, sighs in exasperation: “Ai.” A word bubble appears with the<br />\nChinese character for the sigh (</span><span>哎</span><span>), virtually the same as Ai’s surname (</span><span>艾</span><span>).<br />\nKuang Kuang is hauled off, screaming. In the next frame, the black hand sweeps<br />\naway sunflower seeds arranged in the same “Ai.” Then we hear a grating sound —<br />\nteeth meeting porcelain — followed by an off-screen scream: “Damn it! Who sold<br />\nus these fake sunflower seeds?”</span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Pi San finished the animation before dawn on April 4,<br />\nless than 24 hours after Ai was detained. “I hesitated for a second before<br />\nposting it online,” he told me. “But then I thought, If I don’t put it up, that<br />\nwould be like self-castration.” With a few clicks, he sent “Crack Sunflower Seeds”<br />\ninto cyberspace, posting it onto China’s top video Web sites. In just a few<br />\nhours, a million or more netizens watched the animation online. Then the video<br />\nbegan disappearing from Chinese Web sites one by one, just like the announcers<br />\nin his animation. Pi San lashed out directly at the censors in a Weibo post:<br />\n“You’re like the eunuch who gets worried before the emperor does!” There was no<br />\nresponse. Even in his anger, Pi San was left wondering if the black hand would<br />\ncome for him.</span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>No government in</span></b><span> the world pours more resources into patrolling the<br />\nWeb than China’s, tracking down unwanted content and supposed miscreants among<br />\nthe online population of 500 million with an army of more than 50,000 censors<br />\nand vast networks of advanced filtering software. Yet despite these<br />\nrestrictions — or precisely because of them — the Internet is flourishing as<br />\nthe wittiest space in China. “Censorship warps us in many ways, but it is also<br />\nthe mother of creativity,” says Hu Yong, an Internet expert and associate professor<br />\nat Peking University. “It forces people to invent indirect ways to get their<br />\nmeaning across, and humor works as a natural form of encryption.”</span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>To slip past censors, Chinese bloggers have become<br />\nmasters of comic subterfuge, cloaking their messages in protective layers of<br />\nirony and satire. This is not a new concept, but it has erupted so powerfully<br />\nthat it now defines the ethos of the Internet in China. Coded language has<br />\nbecome part of mainstream culture, with the most contagious memes tapping into<br />\nwidely shared feelings about issues that cannot be openly discussed, from<br />\ncorruption and economic inequality to censorship itself. “Beyond its comic<br />\nvalue, this humor shows where netizens are pushing against the boundaries of<br />\nthe state,” says Xiao Qiang, an adjunct professor at the University of<br />\nCalifornia, Berkeley, whose Web site,<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.net/\"><span>China<br />\nDigital Times</span></a>, maintains <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.net/space/Introduction_to_the_Grass-Mud_Horse_Lexicon\"><span>an<br />\nentertaining lexicon of coded Internet terms</span></a>. “Nothing else gives us<br />\na clearer view of the pressure points in Chinese society.”</span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>So pervasive is this irreverent subculture that the<br />\nChinese have a name for it: egao, meaning “evil works” or, more<br />\nroughly, “mischievous mockery.” In its simplest form, egao (pronounced<br />\n“EUH-gow”) lampoons the powerful without being overtly rebellious. President Hu<br />\nJintao’s favorite buzz word, “harmony,” which he deploys constantly when urging<br />\nsocial stability, is hijacked to signify censorship itself, as in, “My blog’s<br />\nbeen harmonized.” June 4, the censored date of the 1989 massacre of<br />\npro-democracy protesters, is rendered as May 35 — or “535.” There are also more<br />\ncomplex forms of egao, like Hu Ge’s 2010 film spoof, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2010/02/video-satire-hu-ges-%E8%83%A1%E6%88%88-animal-world-the-apartment-dweller-starring-han-han-%E9%9F%A9%E5%AF%92/\"><span>“Animal<br />\nWorld,”</span></a> in which a rare species of Internet users is “saved”<br />\nfrom “compulsive thinking disorder,” i.e., the urge to think freely.</span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Satire is sometimes a safety valve that government might<br />\ngrudgingly permit. Better a virtual laugh, after all, than a real protest. But<br />\nbeing laughed at, as Orwell found during his stint as a colonial police officer<br />\nin Burma, can also be a ruler’s greatest fear. And the Chinese government,<br />\nwhich last year <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/19/world/asia/19beijing.html\"><span>sentenced<br />\na woman to a year of hard labor for a sarcastic three-word tweet</span></a>,<br />\nappears to suffer from an acute case of humor deficiency. “Jokes that mock the<br />\nabuse of power do more than let off steam; they mobilize people’s emotions,”<br />\nsays <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://wenyunchao.com/\"><span>Wen Yunchao</span></a>, an<br />\noutspoken blogger who often mounts sardonic Internet campaigns in defense of<br />\nfree speech. “Every time a joke takes off,” Wen says, “it chips away at the<br />\nso-called authority of an authoritarian regime.”</span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Satirical threads sweeping across the Internet can often<br />\nseem like brush fires whose origins are lost in the conflagration. But behind<br />\nevery outbreak are individuals probing the limits of self-expression, flirting,<br />\noften perilously, with the blurry line between the permissible and the<br />\npunishable. Over the past several months I followed two individuals — the<br />\nanimator Pi San and the blogger Wen Yunchao — in an effort to understand the<br />\ndynamics of “mischievous mockery” and the increasingly serious game of<br />\ncat-and-mouse taking place along China’s digital front lines.</span><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Pi San and Wen are perfect counterpoints — a northerner<br />\nand a southerner who approach</span><span> </span><span>egao</span><span> from<br />\ndifferent angles. One specializes in visual images, the other mainly in words.<br />\nPi San shudders at being considered an activist; he sees satire as an artistic<br />\nway to vent personal frustration. Wen wears the activist label proudly; he<br />\nviews humor as a “weapon of the weak” to mobilize civil society. As the<br />\ngovernment crackdown intensified, each man was forced to adjust his<br />\ncalculations of danger and opportunity: How far could they go before they<br />\ncrossed the invisible line?</span><span></span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><br /></b></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=738338\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"738338\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":989,"categories":[9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
