A leading official also<br />\nwarned of the need to &#8220;strengthen administration&#8221; on a recent visit<br />\nto Sina, which runs the hugely popular Weibo service, China&#39;s domestic rival to<br />\nTwitter. The firm last week suspended user accounts for spreading rumours.</span></p>\n<p><span>China has a vast and complex censorship system, but<br />\nmicroblogs have played an increasing role in spreading news, developing public<br />\ndebate and uncovering scandals.</span></p>\n<p><span>Although sensitive posts are deleted and search terms<br />\nblocked, information often spreads faster than monitors can remove it. Users shared<br />\noutrage at the way officials <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/27/china-train-crash-inquiry\" title=\"\">handled June&#8217;s high-speed train crash in Wenzhou</a> and spread the<br />\nnews of a mass protest in Dalian.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Through microblogs, local news becomes national<br />\nnews,&#8221; said Hu Yong, an expert on Chinese social media.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;When something happens, even in a remote region, news<br />\ncan very quickly spread … Before, the government could effectively control the<br />\nspread of information.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Secondly, Weibo is very inclusive. It draws all the<br />\nsocial classes. It is not only intellectuals but also the middle class, the<br />\nunderclass and even officials.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>He suggested that the Xinhua piece and similar articles<br />\nwere &#8220;a kind of warning, not only to service providers, but to general<br />\nusers&#8221;. Many users feared Wenzhou was a high watermark for the service.<br />\nUsers appeared remarkably free to criticise officials for incompetence and<br />\naccuse them of corruption and cover-up. Crucial footage and accounts from the<br />\nscene were shared millions of times before censors stepped in.</span></p>\n<p><span>The concern for officials is not just sensitive content but<br />\nmass appeal. Sina says its service has 200 million registered users. Its rival<br />\nTencent said in April that it had 160 million and expected that to rise to as many<br />\nas 300 million by the end of the year. &#8220;The rapid advance of this flood<br />\n[of internet users] has also brought &#39;mud and sand&#39; &#8211; the spread of rumours &#8211;<br />\nand to nurture a healthy internet, we must thoroughly eradicate the soil in<br />\nwhich rumours grow,&#8221; said the Xinhua article. It would &#8220;demand<br />\nstronger internet administration from the responsible agencies, raising the<br />\nintensity of attacks on rumours&#8221;, it said.</span></p>\n<p><span>One Weibo user wrote that many people would welcome a<br />\ngenuine attempt to quash lies, but feared it was &#8220;a pretext to cleanse<br />\nso-called rumours and ban the people from telling the truth&#8221;.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another suggested: &#8220;To staunch the spread of rumours,<br />\nhave the central leaders face up to their history, have Xinhua end bogus news,<br />\nhave the National Bureau of Statistics end fake data [sic].&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>Censors face a dilemma. While officials want to continue to<br />\ncontrol the flow of news, the services are now so popular that closing them<br />\nwould cause uproar.</span></p>\n<p><span>More likely, think analysts, is increased monitoring and a<br />\nstricter response to sensitive content, as Sina&#8217;s month-long suspension of two<br />\naccounts may suggest.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;There are of course, many rumours on microblogs, but<br />\nrumours flourish in China partly because of the low level of trust in both<br />\nofficial and commercial media,&#8221; said Jeremy Goldkorn, founder of<br />\nDanwei.com, which follows Chinese media.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;It&#39;s hard not to see the current campaign as both an<br />\nattempt to cool down public discussion on the internet, and to provide a<br />\nframework to discredit news that is broken only on the internet without any<br />\napproval from state or state-approved media outlets.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>The Communist party secretary of Beijing, Liu Qi, warned<br />\nthat internet sites &#8220;must actively explore strengthening administration<br />\nand resolutely blocking the spread of false and harmful information&#8221; when<br />\nhe visited Sina&#39;s offices this month.</span></p>\n<p><span>According to the Wall Street Journal, citing a person<br />\npresent at the meetings, Liu &#8220;also said he hoped more of the discussion on<br />\nWeibo would focus on the beauty of traditional Chinese culture&#8221;.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=738338\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"738338\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":989,"categories":[9203],"tags":[16912]}
