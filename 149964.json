There is many marches supporting Ai Wei Wei. People drew in wall and ask &#8220;Who Is Afraid of Ai Weiwei?&#8221; And use projector to project his image in Chinese milliary office. However, strangely, the hk police acts very strict in these case recently. We contined to have different policies from China but I can feel the environment in HK is changing after HK returns to China. The Chinese milliary office said it will keep their right to sue but the teacher in HK University said there is no law in HK which the Chinese milliary office can use to sue people projecting image. I&#8217;m afraid that the chinese government will harm the freedom of HK. I hope HK will never be a province in China. (In fact I wish HK can be an independent state, like Singapore) I miss the days we can do and say anythings as we want before. I am very worry that the chinese government will force HK police to catch those people who support Ai Wei Wei in some strange reasons. </p>\n<p>posted by Vikki Chan<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />Never surrender to tyranny ! </p>\n<p>posted by Peter Andre Daignault<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />Free him, or 兲朝 die. </p>\n<p>posted by Yibo Wei<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />兲朝 die </p>\n<p>posted by yundan jiacuo<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />Free Waiwai!
