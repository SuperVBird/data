And it has generated intense interest among parents in Hong Kong, whose own upbringing methods are similar to that described by Chua, if not even more extreme.</p>\n<p>Provocatively titled &#8220;Why Chinese mothers are superior&#8221;, the 2,500-plus-word column &#8211; which at times borders on hilarity because of the extreme approach Chua describes in disciplining her two young daughters, Sophia and Louisa &#8211; has generated more than 3,000 reader responses on the Journal&#8217;s website, some with praise but most with vitriol.</p>\n<p>She proudly declared she once kept a daughter up late at night to get a piano piece right, without food and washroom breaks. At another time, she upset guests at a party by telling everyone she once called her older daughter &#8220;garbage&#8221; because she was being disrespectful.</p>\n<p>A few Journal readers admire her honesty, but many accuse her of child abuse. Several posts even threaten violence to Chua, not only for her parenting style but for, as they say, being a racist.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What Chinese parents understand is that nothing is fun until you&#8217;re good at it,&#8221; Chua writes. &#8220;To get good at anything you have to work, and children on their own never want to work, which is why it is crucial to override their preferences.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She argues that Chinese children are often more successful in school &#8211; and later at work &#8211; than Westerners because of the tough discipline their parents impose throughout childhood, with an extreme focus on academic achievements.</p>\n<p>Chua contrasts that with the more &#8220;touchy-feely&#8221; approach she claims is largely favoured by Westerners and which she says produces far less accomplished adults. She says the Western focus on self-esteem often backfires; the child grows up and accomplishes little or nothing.</p>\n<p>Chua also states there is a fundamental difference between American and Chinese mothers &#8211; &#8220;tiger mums&#8221;, she calls them &#8211; though she admits there are gradations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Western parents try to respect their children&#8217;s individuality, encouraging them to pursue their true passions, supporting their choices, and providing positive reinforcement and a nurturing environment,&#8221; she writes. &#8220;By contrast, the Chinese believe the best way to protect their children is by preparing them for the future, letting them see what they&#8217;re capable of, and arming them with skills, work habits and inner confidence no one can ever take away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tom Yam Hin-bong, 64, a Hong Kong-based management consultant who holds a doctorate in electrical engineering and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has raised two daughters in the US. Both are now highly successful adults.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really sad Chua is trying to dictate what kind of life her children should have,&#8221; Yam said. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of disgusting to try to monopolise the children and their characteristics.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yam believes it is far better to inculcate a love of learning and knowledge in children than forcing them to achieve an A in every subject. He questions whether Chua&#8217;s own accomplishments stemmed from her own parents&#8217; strict upbringing or from her father as a role model.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Her father was a very famous engineering professor at UC Berkeley,&#8221; Yam said. &#8220;I read his book on non-linear systems.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yam believes the controversy comes at a time when many Americans are worried about their economy, the decline of American influence aboard, the rise of China and the dominant presence of Asians on the campuses of top US universities.</p>\n<p>While accounting for only 5 per cent of the US population, Asians make up 20 per cent of student bodies of Ivy League schools. At the University of California Berkeley and at UCLA, Asians &#8211; who make up about 13 per cent of the California population &#8211; fill around half the places.</p>\n<p>However, Tracy Yau, the wife of a successful surgeon in Hong Kong, supports Chua. &#8220;I think what she wrote is very positive,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>Her two daughters, aged 15 and 17, are both straight-A students studying at an ESF school, and the eldest, graduating this year, has already been admitted to a top-ranking British university.</p>\n<p>Her daughters started learning French, Japanese, piano, the flute, pottery, tennis and golf while young.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think Chua captures the essence of how most Chinese parents think about the future of their children,&#8221; Yau said. &#8220;Her method may be a bit extreme but what she wrote about setting goals and working to achieve them sounds just about right.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Life is tough. You have to struggle and endure to earn the good things in life. For a young person, studying hard is a kind of struggle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Her older daughter added: &#8220;I think what I learn from mother is how to set goals and work towards them, and never give up &#8230; and the value of hard work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Additional reporting by Howard Goodman</p>\n<p>Ideal approach?</p>\n<p>According to Chinese-American academic Amy Chua, children should never be allowed to:</p>\n<p>    * Attend a sleepover<br />    * Have a playdate<br />    * Be in a school play<br />    * Complain about not being in a school play<br />    * Watch television or play computer games<br />    * Choose their own extracurricular activities<br />    * Get any grade less than an A<br />    * Not be the number one student in every subject except gym and drama<br />    * Play any instrument other than the piano or violin<br />    * Not play the piano and/or violin.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</p>\n<p>Click <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://808080.biz\">here</a> to Circumvent the Great Firewall</p>\n","author":1,"categories":[1],"tags":[]}
