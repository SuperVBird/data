A law professor for more than 20 years, He has been unusually brave about sharing his views on the most sensitive societal issues.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">&#8220;My only intention [ for participating in public discussion] is to use my expertise as a legal scholar to help the public understand what is the law, the legal system and the Constitution,&#8221; he said.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">His interaction with the pub-lic in these circumstances is a two-way street, He explained.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">&#8220;I get to learn about the needs and the problems of today&#8217;s society as well.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">He started out studying the Western legal system, but then moved on to the Chinese. The more he dug in, the more he came face to face with serious injustices and the need for wholesale reform.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">He has written more than 900 blog posts in the last five years, drawing about 10 million visits.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In his articles and speeches, He criticized the high-profile anti-mafia campaign in Chongqing last year and commented on both the controversial mob boss lawyer Li Zhuang case and the stabbing waitress Deng Yujiao case.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">He was one of five legal experts who back in May 23, 2003 suggested the government initiate a special investigation into the watershed Sun Zhigang case that led to important reforms of the hukou residency and police detention systems.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In June 2005, He announced that he would no longer recruit graduate students in protest against the education system, notably the flawed examination system that discriminates against the most talented in favor of pen-pushers.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">He has touched upon topics including democracy, freedom of the press, establishing an inde-pendent judicial system and land privatization at what should have been a private meeting of experts discussing China&#8217;s economy and reform on March 4, 2006.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The minutes of the meeting later leaked onto the Internet where He was targeted by certain media for being &#8220;too aggressive&#8221; and was even called &#8220;a heretic.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">New leftist website wyzxsx. com (home of utopia) has singled out He for abuse after he suggested separation of powers might not be such a bad thing for the People&#8217;s Republic of China.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">He believes there&#8217;s nothing outrageous about his views. &#8220;I only spoke common sense as a legal scholar,&#8221; he said.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In July 2008, He publicly announced he was to leave Peking University and hoped to join a new start-up law school in Zhejiang University, Hangzhou.
