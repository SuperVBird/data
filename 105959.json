It is the whole society<br />\ntalking, so people from various regions of China can discuss now when something<br />\nhappens in a remote village — and the news spreads everywhere.” But this<br />\nInternet world “is more populist and nationalistic,” he continued. “Many years<br />\nof education that our enemies are trying to keep us down has produced a whole<br />\ngeneration of young people whose thinking is like this, and they now have a<br />\nwhole Internet to express it.”</span></p>\n<p><span>While a more<br />\nnationalistic perspective is inevitable to a certain degree during a country&#39;s<br />\neconomic and social progression, we should also keep in mind that China&#39;s<br />\nyounger generation is vastly more educated and globally minded than their<br />\nelders. And, though free speech rights in China are still &#8211; for the most part &#8211;<br />\nculturally opposed to what many of us are used to in the West (and this<br />\nincludes communication on the Internet), the untested newness of the<br />\n&#8220;Internet factor&#8221; is perhaps what is most intriguing as we experience<br />\nan au courant Beijing Consensus develop. </span></p>\n<p><span><span>Posted at 09:02 AM <br /></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span></span></span><span></span></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/opinion/15friedman.html?_r=1\">http://community.nytimes.com/comments/www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/opinion/15friedman.html</a></span></p>\n<h6><span>Readers&#8217;<br />\nComments</span><span></span></h6>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Rui</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Victoria, BC</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>September 15th, 2010</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>10:29 am</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span> </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>&#8220;a whole<br />\ngeneration of Chinese schooled by the government on the notion that the U.S.<br />\nand the West want to keep China down&#8221;</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be too eager to blame this belief on CPP propaganda.

The last two of these were trained as engineers, not as lawyers<br />\nor community organizers. Chinese leaders made many decisions that stepped away<br />\nfrom communism towards capitalism, and would have been unpopular if put to a<br />\nvote. Consider the one-child policy for example. Yet these decisions have<br />\nhelped China prosper in the modern age.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the world&#8217;s most prosperous democracy has made a series of very bad<br />\ndecisions, many of them wildly popular with an electorate which becomes more<br />\nand more poorly informed as time goes on.<b><br />\nThe US invasion of Iraq and the deregulation of US financial markets are two<br />\ndecisions with disastrous consequences which come to mind.</b> Even now,<br />\nneither Congress nor the president has the integrity to face genuine problems<br />\nrealistically. For example, we need to raise taxes to bring the looming<br />\nnational debt under control, as well as provide a much better safety net for<br />\nAmerica&#8217;s poor. We need to control illegal immigration, and push Mexico to take<br />\nresponsibility for its own poor. We need to achieve zero population growth so<br />\nthat we can live within the constraints imposed by a finite planet, and so<br />\nforth.</p>\n<p><b>Plato suggested that democracy was<br />\ninherently unstable, and that instability is becoming all to apparent within<br />\nthe US. Meanwhile, if Friedman is right, the internet may have the opposite<br />\neffect of making China more democratic, and ending its period in which Chinese<br />\ndecisions were made by better informed but benevolent leaders. The point is<br />\nthat in China this is not necessarily an improvement, as the American<br />\nexperience demonstrates. </b>Nothing lasts forever. But although America&#8217;s<br />\nbadly functioning democracy dooms it to a period of decline, there is no<br />\nguarantee that China will replace it as the dominant world power.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>FH</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Tokushima, Japan</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>September 15th, 2010</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>10:27 am</span></p>\n<p><span>Living in Japan<br />\nfor nearly a decade, I am well aware of the imperialistic trends that dominate<br />\nChina. While denouncing any agression against their notion of peace, the trend<br />\nis to dominate every possible &#8220;niche&#8221; of society, be it an<br />\ninternational science committee or a political issue. While, as an example, Japan&#39;s<br />\nTV is mostly sport, cooking or quiz oriented, on a visit to China 5 years ago, <b>I was aware of the large amount of war<br />\nmovies on TV that should remind the viewers that &#8220;this&#8221; was not over,</b><br />\neven if the new tactics are smiling with peace. In my hotel in Guangju, a show<br />\nroom offered items for sale, with among others an almost live-size bronze<br />\nstatue of a storming soldier. This probably reveals a degree of uncertainty at<br />\nthe government level. Social unrest in the form of strikes, significantly<br />\nagainst foreign employers are another symptom of today&#8217;s China.
