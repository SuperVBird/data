This means there are bound to be tons of brand new iPhone users out there who are still getting the hang of their new favorite toy.</p>\n<p>We decided to give these users a hand by both drudging up some tips and tricks that have been around since the beginning as well as a few new hints that only work with iOS 4. Each tip below features a handy graphic to help you figure out the process.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>Keep in mind that many of these will work on all iOS devices so try them out on your iPod Touch and iPad as well!</p>\n<h2>Quick Period</h2>\n<p>Obviously, you can access the period key under the punctuation section but it’s a lot faster to just double tap the space bar. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/1space-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Quick Period</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Hidden Characters</h2>\n<p>Pressing and holding some of the keys on the keyboard will reveal hidden characters. There are quite a few of these if you know where to look. Here’s a list of all the keys that you can hold and expand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Letters: E, Y, U, I, O, A, S, L, Z, C, N</li>\n<li>Symbols: Dollar Sign, Dash, Ampersand, Quotes, Period, Question Mark, Exclamation Point, Apostrophe, and Percent</li>\n<li>Safari “.com” button (brings up .net, .edu and .org)</li>\n</ul>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2keyalts-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Hidden Characters</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Caps Lock</h2>\n<p>After you enable Caps Lock in preferences, double tapping the shift key will cause it to glow blue, indicating that Caps Lock is on. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/3caps-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Caps Lock</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Quick Caps/Symbols</h2>\n<p>Obviously, you can tap the “.?123″ to access the symbols keyboard and the shift key to quickly capitalize a letter, but did you know that you could speed up the process by holding your finger down on one of these keys and then dragging the the key that you want to type? For instance, to quickly type the number “2″  from the main keyboard, hold the “.?123″ key, slide up to the “2″ and then release. You should be taken right back to the main QWERTY keyboard. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/16quick-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Quick Caps/Symbols</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Restart iPhone</h2>\n<p>As you know, to turn off your iPhone, simply hold the sleep button until the option pops up. However, if your phone is frozen, you’ll have to restart by holding the home and sleep buttons until it turns off. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/4restart-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"553\" /></p>\n<p>iPhone Restart</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Screenshot</h2>\n<p>This is one we use every day here at AppStorm. To take a screenshot, hold down the home button, then hit the sleep button (you should see a flash). The image will then be saved into your photos and can be imported to your Mac through iPhoto.</p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/5screenshot-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"553\" /></p>\n<p>Screenshot</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Inspect Link</h2>\n<p>If you see a link in Safari, hold your finger on it to see where it goes. You can also choose to copy it, open it in the current window or open it in a new window. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/6link-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Inspect Link</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Save Image</h2>\n<p>Just as in the previous tip, hold your finger on an image to see more options including the ability to download. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/7image-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Save Image</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Scrolling in a Frame</h2>\n<p>Have you ever tried to scroll in a window that’s inside another window in mobile Safari? It’s a bit tricky. Use two fingers to get the job done. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/8frame-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Scrolling in a Frame</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Tap Dots for Next Page</h2>\n<p>If for some crazy reason you loathe the swiping motion necessary to navigate the home screens, you can tap the area at the bottom instead. Tap to the right of center to go right and to the left of center to go left. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/9dots-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Tap Dots for Next Page</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Quickly Select Word or Paragraph</h2>\n<p>You probably know that to quickly select a word you double tap it, but did you know you can quickly select an entire paragraph with a quadruple tap? </p>\n<p>Surely you didn’t know that one did you? Admit it, you’ve never tried quadruple tapping!</p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/10selection-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Quickly Select Word or Paragraph</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Scroll to Top</h2>\n<p>Everyone should already know this one but I thought I’d toss it in anyway. In Safari, tap the top bar to quickly scroll to the top of the page. Many applications have also built in this functionality so be sure to try it everywhere.</p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/11top-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Scroll to Top</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Zoom In</h2>\n<p>Starting with the 3GS Apple added in many of the accessibility features that you find in OS X. Of these, the most handy is probably the ability to zoom in. After enabling it in Preferences under the Accessibility menu, double tap with three fingers to activate. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/12zoom-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Zoom In</p>\n</div>\n<h2>New iOS 4 Tricks</h2>\n<p>Even if you stood in line all night for the very first iPhone and have owned every model since, there could be many new features that you don’t know about in the latest operating system. Check out these four things to try.</p>\n<h3>Spell Check</h3>\n<p>There is finally a spell check feature! Just tap and hold an underlined word, then tap the “Replace” button to see a spelling suggestion. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/13spelling-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Spell Check</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Lock Screen Orientation</h3>\n<p>The iPhone automatically changes orientation when you rotate it, which can be annoying if that’s not what you want. Double tap the home button and then swipe to access the controls to the left. Here you can control the iPod functionality and/or lock the screen orientation. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/14lock-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Lock Screen Orientation</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Close Background Apps</h3>\n<p>Now that you can multi-task in iOS 4, it’s easy to leave open tons of applications. Follow the same double tap process as in the tip above but this time tap and hold an application icon and then tap the little minus buttons to close any unwanted applications. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/15bkg-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Close Background Apps</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Search the Web and Wikipedia</h3>\n<p>Apple has improved the global search feature in iOS 4 by adding web and wikipedia search options. These are usually located at the bottom of the list of results. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://iphone.appstorm.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/17search-iphone-tricks.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" title=\"trick\" width=\"620\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p>Search the Web and Wikipedia</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Didn’t Learn Anything?
