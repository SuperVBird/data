But Pentagon officials needn&#8217;t worry just yet, for the political heavyweight in question is still in primary school.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span>当中国政坛的一个新秀说他誓将复兴中国并重现汉朝和唐朝时代的辉煌时，无疑地让华盛顿吃了一惊。不过，五角大楼的官员们不必忧虑，因为这个正被讨论的政治巨量级选手还在上小学。</span></p>\n<p><span><br />\n</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Twelve-year-old Huang Yibo has already achieved high office in the Young Pioneers of China (a primary school branch of the Communist Youth League), and his blog – named Qiankun Ruxiu, Chinese for &#8220;the breadth of mind is as wide as heaven and earth&#8221; – has received a reported 1.2 million visitors in the past few days.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span>12</span><span>岁的黄艺博已经荣获少先队员（共青团的小学预备队）的高职位，他的博客——乾坤如袖，中文意思是“就像天空和地球一样的宽广心胸”——在过去的几天里，已经有了</span><span>120</span><span>万的点击量。</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span><br />\n</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>His progress has been the subject of a great deal of attention in the Chinese press. Newspapers have reported that the boy eschewed cartoons at the age of two in favour of the China Central Television&#8217;s evening news, and at seven years old he began reading the People&#8217;s Daily newspaper.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span>他的进步吸引了中国新闻机构的广泛注意。报纸报道说，他两岁的时候，就不看动画片而喜欢看中央电视台的晚间新闻联播。七岁的时候开始阅读《人民日报》。</span></p>\n<p><span><br />\n</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>According to the local Wuhan Evening News, Huang was named as one of &#8220;The Country&#8217;s 100 Outstanding Juveniles&#8221; and &#8220;10 Filial Piety Stars of Wuhan&#8221;.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span>根据当地的《武汉晚报》报道，黄艺博被授予“百名中国优秀好少年”和“十佳武汉孝心之星”。</span></p>\n<p><span><br />\n</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>There are a number of subtle indicators that distinguish Huang from his classmates. The five stripes displayed on his arm denote a high rank in Young Pioneers – to have three is rare.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span>将黄和他的同学区别开来，意味深长。他胳膊上镶有少先队员最高级别的五道杠——三道杠都很稀有了。</span></p>\n<p><span><br />\n</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Photographs recently released by the Pioneers are not dissimilar to publicity shots for a politician showing a smartly dressed child signing autographs, giving speeches to fellow classmates, and shuffling through reams of documents. In one picture, Huang bends down to hold the hand of an elderly lady in a hospital bed.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span>《少先队员》最近发表了一些照片。这些照片与宣传政治官员没有什么不同：秀一秀漂亮地亲笔签名，对同班同学发表演讲，翻看大量的文件。在一张照片中，黄弯着腰在医院里握着一位卧病在床的老太太的手。</span></p>\n<p><span><br />\n</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Comments from Chinese readers on Huan&#8217;s blog give a mixed reaction. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard of five stripes before,&#8221; wrote one reader from Sichuan province in comments translated by the blog chinaSMACK. &#8220;I only know that having stripes all over your body is the outfit of mental patients!&#8221; Another commenter labelled him &#8220;Mini Mao&#8221;.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span>中国读者留在黄的博客的评论好坏交织。“我从来没有听说过五道杠”，一个四川省的评论者写道。这条评论来自翻译过来的博客</span><span>chinaSMACK.</span><span>。“我知道给你的孩子全身加满杠那是父母的病态行为。”另一个评论把他称作“小毛泽东”。</span></p>\n<p><span><br />\n</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>It remains unclear whether the precocious politician is a creation of propaganda, or simply of pushy parents. &#8220;If this had happened 15 years ago, I would say it was probably entirely the creation of the party,&#8221; said Steve Tsang, director of the China Policy Institute at the University of Nottingham. &#8220;It is now conceivable that the parents have played a significant role in making him prominent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><span>这个过早成熟的小政治家是政治宣传的需要，还是仅仅父母的推动，不得而知。“如果这种事发生在</span><span>15</span><span>年前，几乎完全就是党宣传的结果。”诺丁汉大学的中国政策研究所的主任</span><span>Steve Tsang,</span><span>说。“现在可以接受的说法是，父母在推动他成名的过程中起到了一个重要的作用。”</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span><br />\n</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Huang&#8217;s father told a local newspaper that his son was &#8220;just doing what he likes&#8221;.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span>黄的爸爸告诉当地报纸说，他的儿子在做他想做的事情。</span></p>\n<p><strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www1.feedsky.com/t1/511314507/yeeyan/feedsky/s.gif?r=http://article.yeeyan.org/view/224034/194391\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" /></p>\n<form action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\" method=\"POST\"> 定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a><br />\n<input maxlength=\"64\" name=\"EMAIL\" size=\"25\" type=\"text\" /></p>\n<p><input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\" /> <input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\" /> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\" /> </form>\n","author":1,"categories":[20534],"tags":[16445,9993,9091,16444]}
