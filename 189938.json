They were both beaten again and forced to leave the area when they returned to the village this month.</p>\n<p>State media have made little mention of Chen since the official Xinhua news agency called him a &#8216;blind mob organizer&#8217; during his appeal hearing in 2007.</p>\n<p>But in a surprise move last week, two newspapers debated the legal and moral basis of Chen&#8217;s house arrest and the campaign for his release.</p>\n<p>The Global Times, part of the ruling Communist Party&#8217;s People&#8217;s Daily group, weakly criticized the local government&#8217;s handling of Chen but warned activists not to make his case an &#8216;ideological issue.&#8217;</p>\n<p>The Shanghai-based Oriental Morning News challenged the Global Times&#8217; right to be &#8216;the only voice about this incident&#8217; inside China and said the public needed to be told &#8216;who is Chen Guangcheng.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Wang told dpa Tuesday that she believed the pressure from Chen&#8217;s supporters and micro-blog reports of the abuses by the authorities in Linyi had influenced the publication of the two stories.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Our visits, especially what we suffered, &#8230; stirred up the righteous anger of many netizens,&#8217; she said.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1669561.php/Rights-defenders-spur-debate-over-detained-blind-activist\">原文链接</a></p>\n<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4889492683900327351-4953163062774196776?l=freecgc.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n</p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":994,"categories":[1],"tags":[9050,9625,15095]}
