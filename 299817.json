Under the banner &#8220;arts must serve the masses&#8221; and<br />\n&#8220;arts must serve the politics,&#8221; these teams were formed by both<br />\nprofessional and amateur artists to deliver songs, dances, music, and<br />\nminidramas of pure propaganda value to the masses, including workers, peasants,<br />\nand soldiers. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>So Chengpeng is very familiar with the<br />\ninstalled ideology even in his childhood. Perhaps ever since he has been<br />\nfascinated by the Chinese ways of speaking, or, most of the times, not speaking.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>In a talk at Peking University named “SPEAK”<br />\nlast year, Chengpeng traced that during the Great Famine in the late 50s and<br />\nearly 60s, the whole nation lost its language. Not only did they lie to their<br />\nfamily and friends in political struggles, but they also lied to their own<br />\nstomachs. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><i><span>You<br />\ncan’t say “I’m hungry,” and you can’t say “I love you,” and you definitely<br />\ncan’t speak the truth… Speaking, as an animal instinct, a way of thinking, a<br />\nright…it was taken away… Having lost the ability to speak the truth, we will<br />\ntell many lies.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span> </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>For a<br />\npeople that have produced the world’s most beautiful language, “speaking” has<br />\nnow become a great problem. Everyone is bored to death, living in this sterile<br />\nplastic land of official discourse, repeating lies, deceptions, and ridiculous<br />\nclaims that everyone knows to be false.</span></i></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>What does Chengpeng do? No other than<br />\nhelping the Chinese regain their ability to speak. Chenpeng began his career as<br />\na journalist and first rose to prominence for covering on corruption within<br />\nChina&apos;s professional soccer establishment. This coverage prompted persistent and<br />\nanonymous threats against him and his family.</span></p>\n<p><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Chengpeng#cite_note-Diplomat-2\"><span></span></a></span></p>\n<p><span>Then, in 2008, Chengpeng engaged in the investigation<br />\nof collapsed schools after the big Sichuan earthquake. It is this earthquake<br />\nthat turned Chengpeng into an activist, not only joining rescue efforts, but<br />\nalso criticizing the shoddy construction of school buildings in which untold<br />\nnumbers of children died.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>In 2011, Chengpeng announced that he would<br />\nseek political office as an independent candidate in his hometown of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu\" title=\"Chengdu\"><span>Chengdu</span></a>,<br />\nSichuan province. While not technically illegal, the decision represented a<br />\nrare and bold move in a country where candidates for political office are<br />\ntypically appointed by the Party. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Chengpeng went to the office first thing on<br />\nelection day, only to be informed by a guard that the election had already<br />\ntaken place &#8211; at 2.30am. Needless to say, Chengpeng was not elected.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>While doing a lot of activism, <span>Chengpeng</span> never<br />\nstops writing. He becomes one of the most famous Chinese social commentator,<br />\nbest-selling author, and popular blogger as well as microblogger. Chengpeng’s<br />\nnew book “The whole world knows” was published this year and he was forbidden<br />\nto talk at all book-signing events. The picture of him with a black mask and<br />\nwords written on his T-Shirt “I love you all” becomes a symbol for young<br />\nChinese who are fighting for their freedom of speech because “there is no other<br />\nway out”.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Through brave individuals like Li Chengpeng,<br />\nthe Chinese will regain the ability to speak. The whole world knows.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</p>\n<p><span>I offer Chengpeng my congratulations on his<br />\noutstanding achievement in winning the Best Blog award at The Bobs 2013!</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=b4fd4ae247\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/mstlf\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
