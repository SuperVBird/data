But relations between the press and staff traveling with the vice president and Chinese officials guarding access to the leaders are another story entirely.</p></blockquote>\n<p>在高层对话中，中美双方实际上看起来相安无事，而随同副总统出访的人员和守在中国领导人身边的官员与媒体之间的关系却是另一回事了。</p>\n<blockquote><p>Biden&#8217;s schedule Thursday, his first full day in China, included two bilateral meetings with Chinese Vice President Xi Jingping. American and Chinese press were to be allowed in to hear the opening remarks at the start of the first, expanded meeting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>周四是拜登在中国度过的第一个完整的一天，他的日程包括与中国国家副主席习近平举行双边会谈。中美双方的媒体被许可进入到开始的扩大会议报道开场白。</p>\n<blockquote><p>At least that was the plan.</p></blockquote>\n<p>最终，这只停留在一个计划。</p>\n<blockquote><p>Xi spoke first, calling Biden&#8217;s visit a &#8220;major event&#8221; in the U.S.-China relationship and expressing his desire to work with America &#8220;to promote development of relations between our great nations.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>习最先讲话，称拜登的访问对中美关系来说是一件大事，他表达了同美国一道“促进两大国之间的发展”的愿望。</p>\n<blockquote><p>Then Biden spoke, starting with a reference to his first visit to China in 1979, when he saw &#8220;the great wonders&#8221; of the nation. He spoke of his admiration for the Chinese people and the &#8220;great sweep of history.&#8221; And to Xi, he spoke of the importance of developing a close personal relationship, one of &#8220;openness and candor,&#8221; and stated his belief that foreign policy &#8220;is more than just formal visits, it&#8217;s establishing relationships and trust.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>然后是拜登讲话，他以1979年他第一次访华为开场白，他说他那次看到了中国“伟大的奇迹”。他表达了他对中国人民和“对历史伟大胜利”的敬佩。对习个人，他说到发展亲密的个人关系的重要性，是“率真的同志关系”。他相信他的外交政策为“不仅是正式的访问，更能建立双边关系和信任。”</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is my fond hope that our personal relationship will continue to grow,&#8221; Biden said to Xi, who is widely expected to be the next Chinese president.</p></blockquote>\n<p>“我衷心希望我们的个人关系能持久发展。”拜登对习说。习被很多人认为是下一届中国国家主席。</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was right about this time that a near-brawl was breaking out about a hundred feet away from the diplomatic exchanges in the Eastern Hall of the Great Hall of the People.</p></blockquote>\n<p>此时在距离这场外交上的交流100英尺之外的人民大会堂东大厅，一场争论正在上演着。</p>\n<blockquote><p>Only minutes into Biden&#8217;s remarks, Chinese officials had begun to direct reporters toward the exits. Most reporters and the vice president&#8217;s staff objected, saying it was important to cover the entirety of Biden&#8217;s opening statement, as had been the agreement between officials beforehand.</p></blockquote>\n<p>拜登刚的讲话还没开始几分钟，中方官员开始引导着记者往出口走，大多数记者和副总统随行人员反对说，报道拜登的全部演讲是很重要的，就像之前同政府间的协议一样。</p>\n<blockquote><p>A Chinese press aide said Biden was going on far too long for their liking. But in fact, including the consecutive translation of his comments from English to Chinese, Biden spoke only two or three minutes longer than Xi had.</p></blockquote>\n<p>一个中国媒体的助手说拜登说话的内容比他们喜欢的内容多太多。但实际上，包括从英文到中文的翻译过程，拜登的演讲只比习的多两三分钟。</p>\n<blockquote><p>Soon the stern shooing turned into forceful shoving. As reporters tried to stand their ground, Chinese officials locked arms and pushed forward in a show of overwhelming force. Soon enough Biden did finish, but reporters had difficulty hearing the entire thing because of the fisticuffs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>不一会，严厉的驱赶演变成了强制执行，记者试图占领自己的领地，而中方官员主意已定，以胜利者的姿态向前推移。拜登不久结束了他的讲话，但是记者们却因为争吵而很难听到整个讲话。</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hours later, Biden held another meeting with the chair of the National People&#8217;s Congress, Wu Bangguo. And again, Chinese officials attempted to force reporters from the room even as Biden was still speaking.</p></blockquote>\n<p>数小时后，拜登同中国人大常委会委员长吴邦国举行了会谈。中国官员又一次在拜登讲话的时候试图强制将记者赶出会议室。</p>\n<blockquote><p>Though there would not be the kind of physical interaction as in the earlier meeting, the vice president&#8217;s staff was not pleased with their Chinese counterparts, who they felt were showing disrespect to the office and to the country.</p></blockquote>\n<p>尽管在早些的会议上没有身体上的冲撞，副总统的同事仍对中方人员的表现很不高兴，他们认为没有受到这个国家和官员的尊重。</p>\n<blockquote><p>That&#8217;s not to say the display was unexpected. In fact, reporters had been warned beforehand about the potentially over-aggressive conduct. But some more veteran members of the American press and staff said it went further than they&#8217;d seen in the past.</p></blockquote>\n<p>这并不是说这场闹剧是意料之外的。实际上，记者们在之前被警告过潜在的侵犯行为。但对于经验丰富的美国记者来说，他们看到的情景仍比之前见过的严重的多。</p>\n<blockquote><p>Friday will provide another test of the press corps&#8217; muscle when Biden is to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao.</p></blockquote>\n<p>周五拜登将会见中国国家主席胡锦涛，这将是对记者们身体的另一场考验。</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://article.yeeyan.org/view/242278/213496#newComment\">添加新评论</a></p>\n<p><strong>相关文章：</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://article.yeeyan.org/view/208397/213025?from=rss_related\">寄希望未来美中关系 拜登今起访华</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://article.yeeyan.org/view/237937/209974?from=rss_related\">反应泡沫的语言：市场一荣，记者趋同</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://article.yeeyan.org/view/sailorpj/209866?from=rss_related\">利用记者措辞判断市场行情</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://article.yeeyan.org/view/238506/207156?from=rss_related\">中国某报解散了他们的调查队伍</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://article.yeeyan.org/view/234761/203952?from=rss_related\">记者辱骂奥巴马，MSNBC勒令其停职</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www1.feedsky.com/t1/548077022/yeeyan-culture/feedsky/s.gif?r=http://article.yeeyan.org/view/242278/213496\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</p>\n<form action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\" method=\"POST\"> 定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a></p>\n</form>\n","author":1,"categories":[20534],"tags":[9154,12637,17546]}
