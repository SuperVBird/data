Subsequently, reporter Ah<br />\nLiang from Qianlong website was under Laiyang police investigation in Shandong<br />\nprovince after publishing critical reports on a local private corporation.<br />\nLeaving aside their act of conduct during the process of investigating the<br />\ncompanies, the first trouble they had to encounter before the process was that<br />\ntheir identity as reporters was being questioned.</span></p>\n<p><span>The vice president of one newspaper wrote an article on his<br />\nblog with a rather shocking title, “The ‘Wanted’ Qiu Ziming has no legal<br />\njournalist status”. He searched for Qiu Ziming from the General Administration<br />\nof Press and Publication enquiry system and got the result of “There is no such<br />\npress registration”. </span></p>\n<p><span>What is a Press identity then? So important and yet so hard<br />\nto obtain?</span></p>\n<p><b><span>A Press identity of life and death influence</span></b></p>\n<p><span>China&#39;s vocational qualification system was introduced in<br />\n2003, and the Press and Publication Administration issued the “<a href=\"http://www.lawinfochina.com/Law/Display.asp?Id=3990\"><span>Measures for<br />\nthe Administration of Press Cards</span></a>” in January 2005. It was then<br />\namended in August 2009, which clearly stated that news reporting activities in<br />\nmainland China are only for journalists holding a valid press card. </span></p>\n<p><span>For people working in news organizations, the press card<br />\nissue is not only about the right to legal protection during news reporting, it<br />\nis sometimes matter of life and death. On 10th January, 2007, when China Trade News<i> </i>reporter Lan Chengzhang<br />\nwas interviewing in a Coal Mine in Datong, Shanxi Province, he was judged as a fake<br />\nreporter by the mine owner who accused him of not having a press card issued by<br />\nthe General Administration of Press and Publication. Lan was then beaten to<br />\ndeath. Surprisingly, the first thing the local government did after the event<br />\nwas not resolving the case or sending condolences to the deceased’s family, but<br />\nrather to issue a notice of “Cracking down on fake reporters and false news”.<br />\nIt reads, “Whoever does not hold a valid press card certified by the Press and<br />\nPublication Administration is a fake journalist. And reporting news by fake<br />\njournalists is an illegal act.” The above is a formal notice from the local<br />\ngovernment, condemning all journalists without a press card as fake journalists<br />\nand their news illegal. What a ridiculous wonder in the history of Chinese<br />\njournalism!</span></p>\n<p><span>Why is strange news not considered strange in China? One of<br />\nthe reasons is that fake journalists is a serious problem in China. Director of<br />\nthe Press and Publication Administration Liu Binjie even said once, “Whenever<br />\nand wherever fake reporters or fake publications are found, they should be cracked<br />\ndown upon on the spot immediately.” If what he said is valid, then the Datong<br />\nCrackdown was justified by the officials. The question is: is it justifiable to<br />\ngang-beat or order arrest merely because a press card is missing?</span></p>\n<p><span>The authority controlling all the news media in China has<br />\nactually attributed to one of the reasons for the rise of fake reporters. All<br />\nnews media needs approval to register and accept party-led guidance. Press<br />\ncards are issued by the state, reflecting the state&#39;s strict measure to<br />\nreporters’ eligibility. Thus press cards are scarce resources, adding a certain<br />\nkind of privilege to the identity of journalists. The authoritative nature of<br />\nthe Chinese media has led to a common belief among the Chinese citizens that<br />\njournalists have the ability to help solving problems. Moreover, many problems<br />\nin China are hard to solve in reality, even they do appear to have a channel to<br />\nbe solved under official rhetoric. In desperate situation, people can only resort<br />\nto the media for help so as to arouse attention from the wider society and<br />\nhigher-ranking officials, hoping that they can help solve the problems. Owing<br />\nto this, many of the journalists with official press cards are seen to be saviors<br />\nfor the people. No wonder there are so many fake reporters taking advantage of<br />\nthe status. </span></p>\n<p><b><span>Suppression of citizen journalists</span></b></p>\n<p><span>However, with rapid development of the new media, the<br />\npractice that reports or commentators should have qualifications becomes less<br />\nadorned. For example, without a press card, can anyone release information to<br />\nthe web when he/she has witnessed an event? Under China’s special media<br />\nenvironment, many people are not full-time reporters but netizens who have a<br />\ncamera and a blog. When traditional media is being silenced, the people become<br />\nparticipants of events with significant impact. Until then, what is the use of<br />\na piece of paper press card? If China continues to strictly follow the previous<br />\nsystem, citizen reporters will always remain illegal in status. </span></p>\n<p><span>Again, in 2009, after the revision of the “Measures for the<br />\nAdministration of Press Cards,” one official who is in charge of newspapers and<br />\nmagazines from the Press and Publication Administration stressed again when<br />\nmeeting with journalists that, “commercial websites are not news organizations<br />\nand are not approved the legal right to report and release news. Therefore they<br />\ncannot interview or investigate in any news event. The so called ‘citizen<br />\nreporters’ are mostly illegal and are not allowed to report news. Interviewees<br />\ncan refuse to be interviewed and can report them to the officials.” Well then,<br />\nthe local police in Laiyang, Shandong, have every reason to chase after<br />\nQianlong website reporter, Ah Liang. </span></p>\n<p><span>After all, in the mainland, whether you are a journalist is<br />\nnot defined by yourself, nor can your institution prove you one, only the state<br />\ncan.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n","author":176,"categories":[9203],"tags":[]}
