But our awareness is grossly incomplete – and that applies not just<br />\nto direct surveillance by governments that do their best to keep it secret. Our<br />\nknowledge and understanding of how tech and communications companies behave is<br />\nalso shallow, at best.</span></p>\n<p><span>Several valuable<br />\nprojects already seek to measure government censorship of the<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet\" title=\"More from guardian.co.uk on Internet\"><span>internet</span></a>.<br />\nIn particular, the<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://opennet.net/\"><span>OpenNet<br />\nInitiative</span></a><span> </span>has been<br />\ndoing deep research into exposing state-mandated filtering and censorship<br />\naround the world. (Note: OpenNet is operated primarily by university research<br />\ncenters, including the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society, with<br />\nwhich I&apos;ve been affiliated for many years.)</span></p>\n<p><span>The corporate actors<br />\nin the burgeoning surveillance states have not gone unnoticed. But we know far<br />\ntoo little about their practices, and even worthy efforts like the<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/\"><span>Global Network<br />\nInitiative</span></a><span> </span>– aimed at<br />\n&#8220;advancing freedom of expression and<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/privacy\" title=\"More from guardian.co.uk on Privacy\"><span>privacy</span></a>&#8221;<br />\nin the tech sphere by creating operating principles for those companies – have<br />\nproceeded at a snail&apos;s pace. That&apos;s not surprising, given the organization&apos;s<br />\nvaried participants and their goals.</span></p>\n<p><span>Others have been<br />\nworking to help people learn to what extent they can trust at least a few of<br />\nthese companies to protect their data when government snoops come calling. The<br />\nElectronic Frontier Foundation&apos;s <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2013\"><span>&#8220;Who Has Your Back&#8221; project</span></a><span> </span>has surveyed a number of US companies<br />\nin the internet ecosystem to create star ratings across six categories,<br />\nincluding whether the company requires a warrant before giving up information<br />\nto law enforcement. The least protective were Verizon, which got zero stars in<br />\nthis year&apos;s survey; one star each for Apple and AT&T; the best were<br />\nSonic.net, an internet service provider, and Twitter, with six stars each. (The<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/yahoo-fight-for-users-earns-company-special-recognition\"><span>EFF gave Yahoo a special star</span></a><span> </span>for its recently revealed – but<br />\nultimately unsuccessful attempt – to protect users&apos; privacy from what it<br />\nbelieved to be overbearing government surveillance; however,<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/yahoo\" title=\"More from guardian.co.uk on Yahoo\"><span>Yahoo</span></a><span> </span>ranks low overall in the survey.)</span></p>\n<p><span>Meanwhile, the<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://measurementlab.net/\"><span>Measurement Lab project</span></a><span> </span>has created a platform for researchers<br />\nto deploy tools that help them measure how the internet is working, including<br />\nsuch things as bandwidth. The Neubot, for example, is an Italian project<br />\ndesigned to measure<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/isps\" title=\"More from guardian.co.uk on ISPs\"><span>ISPs</span></a>&apos;<br />\nperformance on &#8220;network neutrality&#8221;.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another promising new<br />\nproject,<span> </span><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rankingdigitalrights.org/\"><span>&#8220;Ranking<br />\nDigital Rights&#8221;</span></a>, wants to go deeper and more broadly into<br />\nmeasuring and publicizing corporate data and communications responsibility. Its<br />\nfounder, Rebecca MacKinnon (who is a friend), is a senior research fellow at<br />\nthe New America Foundation, former CNN Beijing and Tokyo bureau chief,<br />\nco-founder of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/\"><span>Global Voices Online</span></a>, and<br />\nauthor of last year&apos;s influential Consent of the Networked: The Worldwide<br />\nStruggle for Internet Freedom.</span></p>\n<p><span>Where the EFF focuses on American companies, MacKinnon is<br />\nlooking globally. She and her collaborators will be asking companies around the<br />\nworld to answer detailed questions about how they operate, with special<br />\nattention to human rights issues. By publicizing the ones that have the best<br />\npractices, she hopes, more will have an incentive to move in that direction.</span></p>\n<p><span>She sees this work as &#8220;part of an emerging ecosystem of<br />\nprojects whose goal is to help the public to obtain measurable information what<br />\ncompanies and governments are doing with and to the internet. The<br />\nbetter-informed we are, the more we can do to make sure what&apos;s happening is in<br />\nour interests and is accountable to us.”</span></p>\n<p><span>All of these initiatives are useful, even essential. Yet, to<br />\noperate in our modern world, we make a series of &#8220;agreements&#8221; with<br />\ncompanies selling us services: they will collect and use data about us in<br />\nreturn for providing the services. This is true for financial institutions,<br />\ninternet companies, hardware vendors and all the others. The agreements are<br />\none-sided: we say yes, and send our money or use the services in return for<br />\nvast privacy invasions, or else we are excluded.</span></p>\n<p><span>But can we, using data from the EFF et al, genuinely challenge<br />\nthe increasingly tight controls companies and governments are exerting? How can<br />\nwe shame an ISP into doing the right thing when the ISP is either effectively a<br />\nmonopoly or part of a cozy duopoly, as is the case in much of the US? Can we<br />\ndepend on Google to protect our data – assuming, as the company swears, that<br />\nit&apos;s doing the best it can today – when management of the company moves into<br />\nnew hands someday? And can we ever trust the tech industry in the context of<br />\nregimes that create secret laws and regulations that make a mockery of what few<br />\nprivacy rights we have?</span></p>\n<p><span>As noted previously in this space, I&apos;m absolutely convinced that<br />\nthere&apos;s an opportunity for big companies and entrepreneurs alike to create<br />\nproducts and services that are designed from the ground up with privacy and<br />\nsecurity in mind. But measurements and data of the sort these organizations are<br />\nproviding is going to be essential along the way. They deserve our support.</span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=b4fd4ae247\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/mstlf\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
