But good<br />\nmemory is a skill and learning how to improve it can help you<br />\nbecome a more creative, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/tag/455\">innovative</a> business leader.</p>\n<p>The first step is changing the way<br />\nyou think about your memory. Your memory isn&#8217;t designed to remember<br />\nnames, find missing keys, or store every password you&#8217;ve ever<br />\ncreated. Your memory is designed to work in context. For example,<br />\nif you try to make a list of every vegetable you can remember, you<br />\nwill make a much longer list if you imagine walking through a<br />\ngrocery store.</p>\n<p>云之：懂得在情境中记忆，我上学时受益匪浅。但缺陷是似乎很少有我能背得滚瓜烂熟的东西，我总是要靠情境或思维帮助记忆。</p>\n<p><strong>Related: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/blog/224501\">3 Easy Exercises to Boost Your<br />\nCreativity</a></strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;What your memory is really for is<br />\ngiving you information about what to expect in the world and how to<br />\nsolve problems in those situations,&#8221; says Art Markman, a cognitive<br />\npsychologist and author of <em><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Thinking-Essential-Problems-Innovate/dp/0399537228/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1349192475&#038;sr=1-1&#038;keywords=smart+thinking\">Smart Thinking</a> </em>(Perigee<br />\nTrade, 2012). Ideally, you want your memory to be filled with<br />\nuseful information that helps you solve tough business<br />\nproblems.</p>\n<p>To store substantive memories that<br />\nwill make you a more <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/tag/775\">creative thinker,</a> try these three tips:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Engage both your body<br />\nand mind.</strong> If you want to remember new ideas, you need to<br />\nlisten and focus. First, stop multitasking. &#8220;The human mind doesn&#8217;t<br />\nmultitask really, it timeshares,&#8221; Markman says. &#8220;You end up<br />\nflipping back and forth between tasks, which makes all of your<br />\nlearning less effective.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To enhance your memory even more,<br />\nengage your body as you listen. Sit up straight, take notes, stand<br />\nup if you feel tired, gesture or move around a bit. &#8220;Engage your<br />\nwhole self,&#8221; Markman says. &#8220;We&#8217;re not just brains in a<br />\nbox.&#8221;</p>\n<p>云之：昏昏欲睡，恐怕什么也记不住。</p>\n<p><strong>Related: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224281\">How to Recognize and Act on Your Best Business<br />\nIdeas</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. Review three points you<br />\nwant to remember.</strong> When you learn new information (by<br />\nreading a book or attending a meeting, for example), you tend to<br />\nremember only about three things. To control what you remember,<br />\nMarkman recommends reviewing the three takeaways that matter most<br />\nto you. &#8220;Otherwise, you leave the three points up to chance,&#8221; he<br />\nsays.</p>\n<p>When the information is fresh in<br />\nyour mind, take a few minutes to review the most useful points. Try<br />\nsaying them into a tape recorder, writing them in a journal, or<br />\nrecounting them to a friend. &#8220;That helps solidify those three<br />\npoints in your memory,&#8221; Markman says.</p>\n<p>云之：看来做笔记十分必要，否则读多少忘多少<img src=\"http://www.sinaimg.cn/uc/myshow/blog/misc/gif/E___7398ZH00SIGG.gif\" /></p>\n<p><strong>3. Explain new concepts to<br />\nyourself.</strong> For an entrepreneur, a rich memory helps you<br />\ncombine disparate ideas to find a novel solution. &#8220;To do that, you<br />\nneed to understand how the world works,&#8221; Markman says. You gain<br />\nthat knowledge &#8212; and remember it &#8212; by explaining new concepts to<br />\nyourself or to someone else.</p>\n<p>When you hear a new idea, look for<br />\ngaps in your understanding and fill them in. Ask yourself, why does<br />\nthis work? How? Look for words that you may not understand even if<br />\n(or especially if) they are familiar business buzzwords. Clarify<br />\nwhat the word means in that specific context or to that particular<br />\nspeaker. The clearer the concepts, the easier they will be to<br />\nremember.  </p>\n<p>云之：仔细思考与既有认识的差异，必须搞清每个字的含义，否则很容易发生误解，而且记不住</p>\n<p>Read more: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/blog/224558#ixzz2Uaw5cMEs\"><br />\nhttp://www.entrepreneur.com/blog/224558#ixzz2Uaw5cMEs</a></div>\n</p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"450\" height=\"309\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=2ea93c5b7b\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/msuvD\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[9400,19845]}
