The trouble is finding all of them. Today we&#8217;re beginning to roll out a simple, but powerful new feature to help address that &#8212; &#8220;Suggestions for You&#8221;. The algorithms in this feature, built by our user relevance team, suggest people you don’t currently follow that you may find interesting. The suggestions are based on several factors, including people you follow and the people they follow. You&#8217;ll see these suggestions on Twitter.com and the Find People section. If you like a suggestion, click &#8220;follow&#8221;; if you don&#8217;t, click &#8220;hide,&#8221; and we’ll try not to suggest that user again.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hcnZ74EIM3A/TFMfdf8quGI/AAAAAAAAABY/WT-FAK2KicU/s1600/recommended_users.png\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hcnZ74EIM3A/TFMfdf8quGI/AAAAAAAAABY/WT-FAK2KicU/s400/recommended_users.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>In addition, you will begin to see recommendations for similar users when you view another account’s profile. If you’re interested in a particular user, you might be interested in these other accounts as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hcnZ74EIM3A/TFMfH5gOP_I/AAAAAAAAABQ/1o2qQ8FQQPI/s1600/similar_users.png\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hcnZ74EIM3A/TFMfH5gOP_I/AAAAAAAAABQ/1o2qQ8FQQPI/s400/similar_users.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></a>All these features will be available for developers, too. We will be launching an API so third parties can provide these suggestion features in your favorite desktop, mobile, and web applications, too.</p>\n<p>Now, go find somebody new to follow. You never know what you might discover&#8230;</p>\n<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23958943-2753774245896921782?l=blog.twitter.com\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"http://img.tongji.linezing.com/1017243/tongji.gif\" /><img src=\"http://img.tongji.linezing.com/997968/tongji.gif\" /></p>\n<p>请看原文：<br />\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.twitter.com/2010/07/discovering-who-to-follow.html\" title=\"Discovering Who To Follow\">Discovering Who To Follow</a></p>\n","author":176,"categories":[1],"tags":[5908,171,8339]}
