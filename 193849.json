Early one<br />\nmorning in July 2009, Wen, who is 39, woke up in his apartment in the southern<br />\ncity of Guangzhou to find a startling message on his Twitter feed:</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/amoiist/status/2657651984\"><span>“I have been arrested by Mawei<br />\npolice, SOS.”</span></a></span><span> </span><span>The jailhouse tweet was from Guo Baofeng, a young friend<br />\nand fellow blogger, referring to a district in the coastal city Xiamen, some<br />\n300 miles away. Minutes later came another tweet from Guo, also in English:<br />\n“Pls help me, I grasped the phone during police sleep.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Then there was nothing.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Wen knew how easily people could disappear<br />\ninto the labyrinths of China’s prison system. Guo, who was then a 25-year-old<br />\nEnglish-language translator, had reposted a video in which the mother of a gang-raped<br />\nmurder victim accused local Xiamen authorities of a cover-up. Now Wen wondered<br />\nhow far the police would go to muzzle the messenger.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The tweets from detention — and the<br />\nsilence that followed — unsettled Wen. But what could he do? Any direct protest<br />\nwould be shut down immediately, even if people could overcome their fear to<br />\nparticipate. Then he noticed</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/07/guo-baofeng-your-mother-is-calling-you-home-for-dinner%E2%80%9D-with-slideshow/\"><span>a phrase<br />\nthat was going viral on the Internet</span></a>: “Jia Junpeng, your mother is<br />\ncalling you home for dinner!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The line’s origins were a mystery, but the<br />\nonline masses latched onto it as a joking commentary on their Web-addicted<br />\ngeneration — lost in cyberspace, unreachable by the outside world. That very<br />\nday, millions retweeted the phrase. Wen, though, gave it a new twist. He urged<br />\nhis tens of thousands of microblog followers to</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2009/07/24/china-calling-guo-befeng-back-home-for-dinner/\"><span>send<br />\npostcards to the Mawei police station and post photos of them online</span></a>,<br />\nall with the same words: “Guo Baofeng, your mother is calling you home for<br />\ndinner!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Nobody can know if the Internet campaign<br />\nmade a difference. But instead of being lost in the prison system — four other<br />\nbloggers arrested for reposting the same video were sentenced to one to two<br />\nyears in prison — Guo was released after 16 days. For Wen, the incident<br />\ncrystallized his thinking. “Humor can amplify the power of the social media,”<br />\nhe told me. “If it hits a nerve, like a case of injustice or abuse, it can be<br />\ncontagious. It’s indirect — just a joke, right? — so people lose their fear of<br />\ngetting involved.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Growing up as the oldest child in a poor<br />\nfamily in rural Guangdong Province, Wen wasn’t always keen to get involved<br />\nhimself. When army tanks crushed the 1989 pro-democracy movement in Beijing,<br />\nWen, who was then a middle-school student prone to skipping class, applauded<br />\nthe crackdown. “I agreed with the government that it was necessary to prevent<br />\nchaos,” he recalls. Wen’s most daring act in college — he was assigned to study<br />\nmachine welding at a technical institute in Harbin, a city in China’s icy far<br />\nnorth — was to smuggle in Cantonese pornography and pop music to help him<br />\nendure the long winters.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>His Internet “awakening,” as he calls it,<br />\ncame years later, when he toiled at a power station near Guangzhou. One night<br />\nafter clocking out, Wen watched a television special beamed in from nearby Hong<br />\nKong that contradicted the official story of the 1989 massacre. Finding a trove<br />\nof information online to confirm its veracity — this was before the Great<br />\nFirewall, erected in 2003, blocked such terms as “June 4” — he emerged with a<br />\nnew conviction: “The Internet will open the door of democracy.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Hungry to learn more, Wen transformed<br />\nhimself over the next decade into an information machine, first as a journalist<br />\nand then as a blogger. Covering events for state-run newspapers and, later, for<br />\ngovernment television, he produced reports and commentaries that toed the<br />\nofficial line. On the Internet, though, he adopted a more freewheeling persona,<br />\nwriting a popular blog called</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://wenyc1230.wordpress.com/\"><span>Ramblings of a Drunkard</span></a></span><span> </span><span>under a pseudonym. Soon, Wen moved full<br />\ntime online, working for the Chinese Internet company Netease and moonlighting<br />\nas one of the country’s earliest citizen journalists. His first article, typed<br />\ninto his cellphone, chronicled the 2007 street protests in Xiamen that succeeded<br />\nin halting construction of a chemical plant.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The censors were never far behind, turning<br />\nWen’s life into a perpetual game of hide-and-seek. First a few posts were<br />\nblocked, then his entire blog, then the Chinese Internet portal he used. An<br />\noverseas Web server worked until the Great Firewall shut it out too. Riding the<br />\nnext wave of technology, Wen began typing out 140-character blasts on Twitter<br />\nand China’s fast-growing microblogging sites. Weibo, a Twitter equivalent that<br />\nbarely existed two years ago, now has 200 million users, churning out some 40<br />\nmillion messages a day. The government, hard-pressed to keep up, leans on Web<br />\ncompanies to censor their own content in return for “self-discipline” points<br />\nneeded to renew licenses. “No place is safe anymore,” Wen says. “But whenever<br />\ncensorship grows, so do the opportunities for sarcasm and satire.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Not long ago, Wen even dared to target<br />\nChina’s most unassailable icon: Mao Zedong. The chairman has been dead for 35<br />\nyears, but his massive portrait still presides over Tiananmen Square. It is<br />\njust one sign of what Wen calls the “awful influence” wielded by the founder of<br />\nthe People’s Republic. Ridiculing Mao is almost unthinkable in China today.<br />\nEven so, on the anniversary of Mao’s death in 2009, Wen urged his online followers<br />\nto join a devious</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/KI17Ad03.html\"><span>“de-Maoification” campaign</span></a>.<br />\nSince “mao” is also the Chinese word for “hair,” he suggested posting<br />\nbefore-and-after shots of shaved body parts — people literally “getting rid of<br />\nmao.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Wen is a beer-bellied man with a thick<br />\nAbraham Lincoln-style beard. Among the hundreds of images of shorn beards and<br />\nhair-free legs that flashed across the Web that day was Wen’s own contribution:<br />\na photo of his rotund belly with its hair in a topiary of the “t” of the<br />\nTwitter logo. Wen’s abdominal salute was funny, but it was also a manifesto for<br />\na more open China — and a dangerous move in his showdown with Chinese<br />\nauthorities.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>When Pi San was</span></b><span> </span><span>a young boy — around the same age as his<br />\nimpish creation, Kuang Kuang — his parents used to smack his hand with a ruler<br />\nevery time they caught him drawing cartoons in the margins of his school books.<br />\n“I was a mediocre student,” says Pi San, whose family lived in a bleak<br />\ncopper-mining town in the hills of Shanxi Province. “My parents thought my<br />\ndoodling doomed me to a life in the mine.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Despite the punishment, Pi San kept<br />\ndrawing, even selling caricatures of Kung Fu heroes to his friends. Nearly two<br />\ndecades later, Pi San runs Hutoon, the animation company he founded in 2005.<br />\nHutoon’s staff of 50 young designers fills most of a floor in “798,” a trendy<br />\ndistrict of art galleries, studios and cafes built on the remnants of a<br />\nmilitary electronics factory in northeastern Beijing. The young men and women —<br />\nmost dressed in black, like their boss — huddle over banks of computers, the<br />\nclicketyclack of keyboards resounding in the high-ceilinged industrial space.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>When I first visited his fourth-floor<br />\nstudio in early March, Pi San seemed to move easily between his roles as<br />\nentrepreneur and provocateur, a reflection of what he jokingly calls his<br />\nmultiple-personality disorder. A few years ago, Hutoon produced an animated<br />\nseries for China Central Television — the government’s main propaganda arm —<br />\nbut Pi San chafed at the lack of creative freedom. “Even CCTV’s cartoons are<br />\nall about indoctrination, not entertainment,” he said. Now he and his staff<br />\ncrank out animated Internet ads and videos for clients including rock stars and<br />\nFortune 500 firms like Motorola and Samsung.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>In mid-April, I watched Pi San and his<br />\ncrew work on an episode of</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/youku-to-launch-chinas-most-ambitious-web-serial-118979624.html\"><span>“Ms.<br />\nPuff,” </span></a>Hutoon’s most lucrative animation series. Centered on a<br />\nrisqué but apolitical female character — censors notice Puff only when the<br />\nstrap on her camisole slips — the series is the first original animated content<br />\ncommissioned by</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youku.com/\"><span>Youku</span></a>, the Chinese equivalent of YouTube. Two<br />\nweeks earlier, Youku had been one of the first Web sites to delete his<br />\nanti-censorship satire, “Crack Sunflower Seeds.” This didn’t matter to Pi San.<br />\nHutoon’s financial future depended on the success of “Ms. Puff.” “You have to<br />\nhave a split personality to succeed in China,” he told me. “With some<br />\nanimations, I make money. With others, I just make fun.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>That afternoon, though, the boss was<br />\npreoccupied. There was no news of Ai Weiwei, and Pi San’s thoughts about the<br />\nfuture — that of his wife and their 7-year-old son — cycled between anger, fear<br />\nand resignation. Leaving Hutoon’s main studio, he led me to a back room filled<br />\nwith heaps of corrugated cardboard, which were the miniature sets used in the<br />\nKuang Kuang animations. “This is where I come when my emotions are running<br />\nhigh,” Pi San said, bending down to examine the eight-inch-tall room that<br />\nloomed large in “Crack Sunflower Seeds.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Nearby was a tiny school building featured<br />\nin Pi San’s first Kuang Kuang satire in 2009, a mordant swipe at the education<br />\nsystem called “Blow Up the School.” An instant Internet sensation among Chinese<br />\nyouth, the animation generated a few million hits on its first day and so<br />\nangered officials that they slapped him with a fine for “inappropriate content.”<br />\nAs more irreverent Kuang Kuang videos appeared, Internet fan clubs formed in<br />\nnearly every Chinese province, turning the bubbleheaded boy and his creator<br />\ninto minor cult figures.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>None of Pi San’s work has evoked China’s<br />\nsocial ills more provocatively than “Little Rabbit, Be Good,” made last<br />\nJanuary. The four-minute “greeting card” to mark the Chinese Year of the Rabbit<br />\nbegins as a soothing bedtime story about bunny rabbits. But as Kuang Kuang<br />\ndrifts off to sleep, the story morphs into a nightmare. Ruled by tigers (the<br />\noutgoing zodiac sign) who promise to “build a harmonious forest” — a pointed<br />\njab at Hu Jintao’s catchphrase — the rabbits suffer an endless series of<br />\nabuses. Babies die from drinking poisoned milk. A protester fighting forced<br />\neviction gets crushed under a tiger’s car. A reckless driver kills a rabbit in<br />\na hit-and-run and boasts about his high-level police protection.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The thinly disguised allegory is based on<br />\nreal-life events that sparked outrage on the Internet. The ending, however, is<br />\nsheer fantasy. Instead of accepting their fate, the rabbits rise up in revolt,<br />\nripping their tiger overlords apart with their bare teeth in a catharsis of<br />\n“South Park”-style violence. The uprising ends with a warning: “Even rabbits<br />\nbite when they are pushed.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Pi San knew “Little Rabbit” might have<br />\ncrossed the line. After consulting a fortuneteller — “I wanted to know if this<br />\nwould cause me trouble,” he said — he hedged his bets, uploading the video to a<br />\nfew small fan Web sites in the middle of the night. “Little Rabbit” still<br />\nreceived more than 70,000 hits within two hours, he says. By the time censors<br />\ndeleted the versions proliferating across the Internet two days later, an<br />\nestimated three to four million people had seen it. Local media didn’t touch<br />\nthe story, but foreign journalists pressed him on the video’s political<br />\nmessage. His coy response: “I only made a fairy tale.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Pi San’s dark satire landed just as<br />\npopular revolutions fueled by social media in Tunisia and Egypt were beginning<br />\nto topple dictators. A few weeks later, Chinese bloggers who alluded online to<br />\nthe possibilities of a similar “jasmine” revolution in China would be detained.<br />\n“I was worried,” Pi San admitted. “The line moves all the time, so we never<br />\nknow where we stand.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b><span>Most Chinese Internet</span></b><span> </span><span>users don’t give the invisible line<br />\nbetween acceptable satire and detainable offense a second thought. They may<br />\nknow it exists, but their online activities — shopping, blogging, gaming,<br />\nnetworking — remain safely within the confines of the Great Firewall. But the<br />\nboundary is of the utmost concern for a growing number of artists and<br />\nactivists. “The government’s primary means of control is the fuzzy line,” says<br />\nDavid Bandurski, a researcher at the</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cmp.hku.hk/\"><span>China Media Project</span></a></span><span> </span><span>at Hong Kong University. “No one ever<br />\nknows exactly where the line is. The control apparatus is built on uncertainty<br />\nand self-censorship, on creating this atmosphere of fear.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Wen felt the line shift a year ago, after<br />\njudges in Oslo awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the jailed Chinese writer</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/09/world/09nobel.html\"><span>Liu Xiaobo</span></a>. Few<br />\nChinese had ever heard of the man behind <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/chinas-charter-08/\"><span>Charter<br />\n08</span></a>, the human-rights declaration that, like Liu’s name, was banned<br />\ninside the Great Firewall. But the government was apoplectic. Chinese officials<br />\nsmeared the “criminal” Liu in the press, pressured foreign countries to boycott<br />\nthe ceremony and blocked a raft of new words on the Internet, even “Norway” and<br />\n“Nobel.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>When the banned words extended to the<br />\nphrase “empty chair” — the most conspicuous sign of</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/world/europe/11nobel.html\"><span>Liu’s<br />\nabsence at the Nobel ceremony</span></a></span><span> </span><span>— Wen hit on an idea. If the words were<br />\nnot allowed, why not post photos of empty chairs as a tribute to Liu? “Everyone<br />\nhas an empty chair,” Wen pleaded with his 40,000-plus followers on Twitter and<br />\nWeibo. “If we only watch, then one day [the empty chair] might appear by your<br />\nfamily’s dining table as well.” At his urging,</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.slide.com/r/Ef7g2OKK4j_6OP7UzJeCmpOMPdaj1u5h?previous_view=mscd_embedded_url&#038;view=original\"><span>bloggers<br />\nposted dozens of seemingly innocuous pictures online</span></a>, from an empty<br />\nchair in a Van Gogh painting to a magazine ad for an Ikea lounger. The censors<br />\neventually caught on to the joke, but not before Wen had turned a bit of<br />\nmicroblog mischief into a human rights statement.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Three months later came the broad<br />\ncrackdown seeming to stem from Beijing’s paranoia about the possible domestic<br />\nrepercussions from the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. Wen was<br />\nvisiting Hong Kong when he received an e-mail warning from Chinese<br />\npublic-security agents: “Don’t come home. You’ll be arrested before you even<br />\nsee your wife and son.” His was now the empty chair. Wen decided to wait out<br />\nthe threats in Hong Kong, which is governed by different laws than the rest of<br />\nChina. Wen’s absence may have spared him detention or prison, but now he was in<br />\nlimbo.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>When I visited Wen in Hong Kong in April,<br />\nhe was living in a temporary apartment with a row of shirts drip-drying in the<br />\nwindow. Dinner consisted of a six-pack of beer followed by sausages fried up at<br />\n1 a.m. At one point, he pulled out his BlackBerry. “Gone, gone, gone,” Wen<br />\nsaid, as he scrolled down a list of friends who had vanished, most likely into<br />\npolice custody.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Wen’s Twitter account was now swarming<br />\nwith the gadflies of the 50-Cent Party, which is the nickname for commentators<br />\nwho reportedly get paid 50 Chinese cents for every pro-government post. He<br />\nshowed me the barrage of disparaging tweets he had received, along with two<br />\nfake Twitter accounts the 50-Centers had set up to look like his. More menacing<br />\nwere the text warnings from anonymous senders who seemed to know everything<br />\nabout him: his identification number, his travel itineraries, even details<br />\nabout his wife, his 10-year-old son and his parents.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Early in the evening, Wen scoffed at the<br />\nintimidation attempts. “The government has too much invested in the Internet<br />\nfinancially to shut it down, so all it can do is resort to scare tactics,” he<br />\nsaid. But as the night wore on and the beer cans piled up, he confided: “I’m<br />\nworried they might pick me up even here in Hong Kong. I’m even more frightened<br />\nfor my family.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>The following day, I joined Wen on an<br />\nexcursion to Lingnan University, along Hong Kong’s border with mainland China,<br />\nwhere he was to give a talk about Internet activism. On the train ride out, he<br />\nspoke about his tenuous life in Hong Kong. A local satellite television company<br />\nhad hired him to develop a show that would beam propaganda-free reports into<br />\nChina. At night, Wen still tweeted prodigiously, launching jokes and spoofs<br />\nover the Great Firewall, like a medieval catapulter outside the castle<br />\nramparts. His wife and son would join him in Hong Kong months later, but Wen’s<br />\ninability to return freely to his homeland left him depressed. “I got angry the<br />\nother day when a friend called me a </span><i><span>liuwang</span></i><span>, an exile,” he told me. “It’s such a sad<br />\nword. I never thought it would apply to me.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>At the university that evening, a table<br />\ncovered in red velvet had been set up on a small outdoor stage. Wen was handed<br />\na microphone, but it proved unnecessary. Fewer than a dozen students stopped to<br />\nlisten. The train home skirted within a few hundred yards of the mainland<br />\nChinese border. Hurtling through the darkness, Wen looked up from his<br />\nBlackBerry and gazed out toward the border, the one line he may never cross<br />\nagain.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>As a cocoon of heat and smog enveloped<br />\nBeijing last June, Pi San began to wilt. Two months had passed since Ai Weiwei<br />\nwas detained, and the artist’s fate and whereabouts were still unknown. The<br />\npolice had also detained another close friend of Pi San’s, the rock musician</span><span> </span><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/30/world/asia/30briefs-China.html\"><span>Zuoxiao<br />\nZuzhou</span></a>, just days after a live performance in which the words “Free<br />\nAi Weiwei!” appeared on a giant screen above him. The musician was released<br />\nwithin a day, but Pi San was spooked. He shelved an idea for another Kuang<br />\nKuang satire and began, for the first time, to consider seriously his friends’<br />\nadvice to leave the country.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Then, on June 22, came a surprise: Ai<br />\nreappeared at his home after 81 days in detention. The artist provocateur, much<br />\nthinner now, was uncharacteristically silent. Though not formally charged with<br />\na crime, he was still under a form of house arrest “pending further<br />\ninvestigation” into tax fraud. Two days later, Pi San rode his electric bicycle<br />\nto the blue door of Ai’s studio — “like a delivery boy,” he said. High-spirited<br />\nas ever, Ai marched back and forth across the small room, showing Pi San how he<br />\nhad lost so much weight. The two friends talked for hours. Given Ai’s house<br />\narrest, their plan to collaborate on a satirical animation would have to wait.<br />\nWhen Pi San was about to leave, Ai gave him a memento from his days in custody:<br />\na couple of stale biscuits, part of his “detention diet.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Many artists and bloggers interpreted Ai’s<br />\nrelease as merely a face-saving measure to help Premier Wen Jiabao avoid<br />\nembarrassment when he traveled to Europe a few days later. Dozens of other<br />\nlawyers and Internet activists were still held in detention without formal charges,<br />\nwhile the harassment of others continued unabated. “I can’t say if anything has<br />\nchanged,” Pi San said, “but it was a big relief” to see Ai back in his home.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>I dropped by Pi San’s studio again in<br />\nJuly. This time, I found his 7-year-old son, his head shaved for summer,<br />\nsitting at his father’s wooden desk and playing a game on an iPad. Pi San<br />\nshuffled around in shorts and sandals, relaxed and happy. His wife, a fellow<br />\npainter whom he met at college, worked on accounting ledgers at a table nearby.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Business had never been better. The first<br />\n10 episodes of “Ms. Puff” had pulled in an average of two million viewers, more<br />\nthan half of them women between 18 and 30. The Youku series’s success raised ad<br />\nrates, Hutoon’s largest source of revenue, and several other Web portals had<br />\napproached Pi San with offers, eager to entice his young viewers to their sites<br />\ntoo.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>In his darkest moments, Pi San vowed never<br />\nto make another satire again. Shadowboxing with censors and security agents was<br />\ntoo nerve-racking, and the risks to his family were too high. Now, in the wake<br />\nof Ai’s release, his fear was subsiding. “I think the government still looks at<br />\nwhat I do as just cartoons, child’s play,” he said, struggling to explain why<br />\nother artists and bloggers were detained or forced into exile while he escaped<br />\nunscathed. It is a misconception Pi San is happy to embrace, even if, as he put<br />\nit, “animated cartoons may be the most realistic way to capture the absurdity<br />\nof our country.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span>Not long ago, Pi San started gravitating,<br />\nonce again, to the back room filled with miniature cardboard sets. “I think I<br />\nhave a few moves left,” he said. He has already mapped out three new Kuang<br />\nKuang episodes. The theme of the next one? Pi San flashed a little grin. “It’s<br />\na game of hide-and-seek.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><i><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"mailto:brooklarmernyt@gmail.com\"><span>Brook Larmer</span></a></span></i><i><span> </span></i><i><span>lives in Beijing and writes for National<br />\nGeographic and other publications.</span></i></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><i><span>Editor:</span></i><i><span> </span></i><i><span><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"mailto:v.titunik-MagGroup@nytimes.com\"><span>Vera Titunik</span></a></span></i></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":989,"categories":[9203],"tags":[3764,16912,8923]}
