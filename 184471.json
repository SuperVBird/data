Both the evidence and charges<br />\nagainst him were virtually the same as those of his previous trial,<br />\nbut this time he was sentenced to death.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Months earlier, the Yunnan Provincial<br />\nHigh Court had given Mr. Li a lighter sentence tantamount to life<br />\nimprisonment – overturning a lower court’s death sentence. But the<br />\nhigh court’s leniency sparked a massive public outcry demanding<br />\nthat Li be sentenced to death. “If Li Changkui doesn’t die, there<br />\nis no law in China!” a commenter in an online forum<br />\nwrote.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">It was this onslaught of public<br />\npressure that ultimately led to an unusual decision to retry<br />\nLi.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Li’s case, the latest in a series of<br />\ncontroversial death penalty decisions, shows that the increasingly<br />\nopen debate on death penalty reform in China can be a double-edged<br />\nsword: Though the contingent of lawyers, scholars, journalists, and<br />\njudicial officials who advocate for reform has grown, so has the<br />\nability of the general public to pressure courts to change<br />\nsentences perceived as too lenient – a development some say verges<br />\non mob justice.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">“When it comes to popular will, I&#8217;m<br />\nconflicted,” says Liu Renwen, a legal scholar at the Chinese<br />\nAcademy of Social Sciences. “On one hand, when the public holds the<br />\ncourts accountable, it prevents problems like corruption, and<br />\nthat’s a positive function. But on the other hand, [in this case]<br />\nit seems like popular will has too much power.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">World&#8217;s leader in<br />\nexecutions</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">China infamously executes the largest<br />\nnumber of people in the world per year. Amnesty International pegs<br />\nthe figure in the thousands, but the true number is a state secret.<br />\nThough there are relatively few intellectuals in China who favor<br />\ncompletely abolishing the death penalty, judicial reform advocates<br />\nsay there is growing support for reducing the number of death<br />\npenalty sentences courts hand out.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">That movement reached a milestone in<br />\nFebruary, when an amendment to China’s criminal code struck down 13<br />\ncharges from the list of crimes punishable by death, including<br />\nsmuggling historical relics and evading taxes. The amendment was<br />\nheralded as evidence of the government’s commitment to reducing the<br />\nnumber of criminals put to death.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">“The Supreme People’s Court in the<br />\npast three to five years has been working hard to reduce the number<br />\nof death sentences,” says He Weifang, a legal scholar at Peking<br />\nUniversity and longtime activist for judicial reform. “But when it<br />\nmeets with cases that spur major public indignation … the Supreme<br />\nPeople’s Court basically can&#8217;t endure the pressure that comes from<br />\npublic opinion and the Party. They can only apply the death<br />\npenalty.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The exact relationship between public<br />\npressure and Li’s retrial is unclear. Legal scholars say it is<br />\nunlikely that public pressure alone forced the court to change the<br />\nsentence, but most point to it as a dominant factor.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Courts under pressure</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Courts are constantly under pressure<br />\nnot to appear “soft on crime,” says Jon Kamm, executive director of<br />\nthe San Francisco-based Duihua Foundation, which conducts research<br />\non the death penalty in China. “If you’re constantly handing down<br />\nunpopular decisions, it will affect your chances for promotion,” he<br />\nexplains.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In China, microblogs and online<br />\nforums have become a kind of megaphone for critics. After the high<br />\ncourt&#8217;s first ruling, the victim&#8217;s family posted messages online<br />\ndecrying the decision and calling for Li to be executed.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The messages struck a chord with<br />\nnetizens across China, turning a local murder case into a national<br />\nstory.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Despite the wave of criticism after<br />\nthe Yunnan Provincial High Court issued its first sentence, it<br />\ninitially appeared that the court was willing to stand behind its<br />\ncontroversial decision. Tian Chengyou, the court’s deputy chief<br />\njustice, defended the court’s decision to reduce Li’s sentence at a<br />\npress briefing July 6. Tian pointed out mitigating factors in Li’s<br />\ncase, including that Li agreed to compensate the victims’ family<br />\nand that he turned himself in.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">“Society should be more rational,”<br />\nMr. Tian told journalists. “We can’t sentence someone to death<br />\nbecause of public anger.”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">But just days later, the court announced its<br />\ndecision to hold the retrial. On Aug. 22, a crowd of villagers<br />\nformed around the municipal courthouse where the retrial was taking<br />\nplace. The crowd stayed past dusk, shouting and brandishing signs,<br />\nChinese news media reported.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The cries for blood in response to the Li case<br />\nmirrors another high-profile death penalty case this spring, in<br />\nwhich a university student murdered a young woman to cover up a<br />\nhit-and-run accident. Like the Li case, that case also elicited an<br />\noutpouring of public rage, particularly drawing on perceptions of<br />\nthe defendant’s privileged family background.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Legal experts say it’s still too early to<br />\ndetermine whether these cases will have any long-term impact on how<br />\npublic opinion shapes court rulings in China.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">“The real problem isn&#8217;t public opinion; it&#8217;s that<br />\nthe courts just aren’t independent enough,” says Xu Zhiyong, a<br />\nwell-known legal scholar and human rights activist. “That&#8217;s what’s<br />\nnot as it should be.”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n</p>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?AddNewUserDirect\">\n定期获得翻墙信息？<a href=\"http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=750556\">请电邮订阅数字时代</a> <br /><input name=\"EMAIL\" maxlength=\"64\" type=\"text\" size=\"25\" value=\"\"><br />\n<input name=\"FEEDID\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"750556\"><br />\n<input name=\"PUBLISHER\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"7485568\"><br />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"订阅!\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":990,"categories":[9203],"tags":[17796,17615,10731]}
