The<br />\nactivities of the party elite are normally reported in a carefully scripted<br />\nmanner, often delayed by a few days, by the state-run media.</span></p>\n<p><span>The fawning and somewhat dull reporting on the blog is raising<br />\nspeculation on the Internet that China&#39;s leader, or rather his aides or<br />\nbodyguards, are behind the accounts.</span></p>\n<p><span>The anonymous blogger denied the rumors Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;I&#39;m not a party member, nor a government official, nor do<br />\nI have anything to do with General Secretary Xi&#39;s team,&#8221; said a statement<br />\non the blog, which appears on the government sanctioned website used for<br />\nTwitter-like postings.</span></p>\n<p><span>The statement noted that other leaders such as Obama and Russian<br />\nleader Vladimir Putin, &#8220;all have their fan groups, it&#39;s my right to be a<br />\nfan of who I want.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>Media analyst Jeremy Goldkorn doesn&#39;t buy that explanation.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;My instinct says it&#39;s something fake, like most things are<br />\nhere. Somebody in or close to the system is doing it, but that doesn&#39;t<br />\nnecessarily mean Xi&#39;s people are doing it,&#8221; said Goldkorn, whose<br />\n&#8220;Danwei&#8221; website translates Chinese media articles into English.</span></p>\n<p><span>Obama&#39;s official Twitter account has almost 27 million<br />\nfollowers. In China, the ruling Communist Party blocks Twitter but similar<br />\nsites that allow people to post messages and opinions have grown hugely<br />\npopular.</span></p>\n<p><span>Xi employs no such social media tools officially. &#8220;Study Xi<br />\nFans Group&#8221; appears on Sina Weibo, which is among the most widely used<br />\nsites in China and one that complies with government censorship rules. The fan<br />\ngroup&#39;s followers have more than tripled in recent days to over 465,000.</span></p>\n<p><span>The immediacy of the postings on the site even caused the<br />\nstate-controlled national broadcaster CCTV to remark on its microblog that<br />\n&#8220;Study Xi Fans Group&#8221; is &#8220;quicker and closer than us.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>Some Chinese Internet users are hopeful that the blog account is<br />\na trial run for Xi and other leaders to launch their own microblogs, which may<br />\nhelp make them more responsive to complaints or concerns of average citizens.<br />\nChina has 564 million Internet users and 309 million microblogging accounts,<br />\naccording to the state-run Xinhua News Agency.</span></p>\n<p><span>Media analysts in Beijing say that the party&#39;s distaste for<br />\ntransparency runs too deep.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Communist Party&#39;s &#8220;culture of secrecy&#8221; and tight<br />\ninformation controls make opening a microblog &#8220;a highly risky thing for<br />\nChina&#39;s leaders,&#8221; said Hu Yong, an Internet and new media expert at Peking<br />\nUniversity.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;Usually they are faceless bureaucrats, as if you stand out<br />\ntoo much your colleagues and other officials will take a different look at you,<br />\nand speculate what you would with all that personal exposure,&#8221; he said.</span></p>\n<p><span>Hu and others say the Internet remains too spontaneous and<br />\nscandalous for leaders to risk entering what is the freest place of expression<br />\nin China. That is true even though China&#39;s Internet is heavily censored and<br />\nInternet firms themselves must be careful not to agitate the government too<br />\nmuch if they wish to keep their business licences.</span></p>\n<p><span>There is evidence that Xi is online.</span></p>\n<p><span>The microblog was founded in November after Xi took over. If it<br />\nreally represents Xi&#39;s team making its foray into weibo, or microblogging,<br />\nlawyer Li Jinsong wrote that it would overtake actress Yao Chen and writer Han<br />\nHan to become the mainland&#39;s most popular.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some are taking a chance it is him, sending messages to the<br />\nmicroblog asking for help addressing various injustices. In China people often<br />\nfail to achieve satisfaction through the party-controlled courts and believe<br />\nthat traditional, state-run media ignores their plight.</span></p>\n<p><span>The blog has responded to such requests by asking people to<br />\nstate their situation with clear detail.</span></p>\n<p><span>China&#39;s government is more transparent than before and strongly<br />\nencourages departments to have a social media presence, said Goldkorn,<br />\n&#8220;but it&#39;s still not the style of China&#39;s leaders to be transparent about<br />\nwhat they&#39;re doing, and that reticence extends to social media.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>China&#39;s bookstores stock many biographies of foreign leaders<br />\nsuch as Obama but shoppers will not find titles on their current leaders. The<br />\nclosest that Xi&#39;s predecessor Hu Jintao came to an online presence was the rare<br />\noccasional Q&#038;A at a state media website.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#8220;If President Xi can have a weibo account or even Twitter,<br />\nthat would be a great leap forward for the leadership,&#8221; said Hu. &#8220;I<br />\ndeeply doubt this generation will do it,&#8221; he said, in reference to the<br />\n&#8220;fifth generation&#8221; of party bosses since Mao Zedong, led by Xi, who<br />\nis expected to serve for the next decade.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<p><small>本文由自动聚合程序取自网络，内容和观点不代表数字时代立场</small></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?hl=zh-CN&#038;formkey=dGRpN3FrVThuMFFsZHBZcmNGLW94dEE6MQ\" width=\"510\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading&#8230;</iframe></p>\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=17daa75df533f6c6ff72e51ab&#038;id=2ea93c5b7b\">\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/msuvD\">墙外新闻实时更新 欢迎订阅数字时代</a><br />\n <br /><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" id=\"mce-EMAIL_in_post\" size=\"25\" style=\"display:block;\" placeholder=\"请输入您的邮件地址\" required><br />\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"点击订阅\" name=\"subscribe\" style=\"height: 20px;\" id=\"in_post_subscribe\"><br />\n</form>\n","author":1004,"categories":[18270,18269,9203],"tags":[16912,8923]}
